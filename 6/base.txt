MrPresident  ARKIPEL are u OG sir?
Yeah but I dont have proof  I did nothing capture it  I hope we all make it
its still on progress right?
I was literally under 500
i click when it was 300 ish
still no og role for me
mother told me i was born an OG
I was og .. why the role is vanished
sir can you add cooldown here?
was everyone timelocked or just me?
i was at 498 lol no og
  i think i got in before 500 haha
im wthin 500  but why no role ?
YOOO FRIDGE!! hope ure in first 500 g
 Moderator please add cooldown here for temporary. hard to read.

ShihTzu  what about those who have to wait 10 minutes to react to the role?? my friends need to wait 10 minutes to press it but entered before 500 members??
Hahaha JIMEK MASTER21 hope so

u wil give role OG manual ??
Hope Im in the OG as well I made it in around 400 JIMEK MASTER21
Im guessint seperat the og and non og
i react to the snake icon when it is 270 only
they are doing manually
LFG fam.. theyre prolly checking it u will get it..
please have patient buddy.
Love to join the OG group
how did they get that
ShihTzu i reacted but cant access to the server for sometimes
hopefully still can get OG role haha. Was stucked on bot hahahaha
Is it manually or automatically?
what about those who have to wait 10 minutes to react to the role?? my friends need to wait 10 minutes to press it but entered before 500 members??  ShihTzu
We will get it in no time.
hows everyone doing today?
Yes sir  being hopeful
maybe mod take time to sort out and assign role manually
yeah weve discontinued the auto role because of a massive influx and to ensure that the first 500 got the OG role
Is the verification bot lagging? because I react when it display 300 and yet i got no role? or i already joined when the member already exceed 500? please kindly enlighten me to the condition... thank you   cc ShihTzu MagnusDrake
is mod manualling it?
its the cooldown i guess
I reacted while it was 450
I was member 450 but the button wouldnt activate the server for me
we are the 500 one tho
art looks cool btw team
the button is stuck bro
What if some of them were bots
it was 370  when i joined then no OG for me ?  sad
i got in before its 500
We are still adding roles.
We will add OG to the first 500 members manually. Please stay tuned.
So the bot collected the first 500 members that react? I mean do you have the data sir?
Oh so we will still get the OG role coz I was here like when 200 only ShihTzu
Hello I was stuck for 10mins
it was 370  when i joined then no OG for me ?  sad
wait on it i guess. doing it manually
dw guys theres still 1500 General Whitelist
yes sir thanks for info
so the og already closed yeah?
glad to be here early!!
was it the first 500 to click the react?
yah yah i guess i need to be patient
im sure im number 481 hahha
Sorry for tagging butwhat about those who have to wait 10 minutes to react to the role?? my friends need to wait 10 minutes to press it but entered before 500 members??  alot of people will ask the same question
ShihTzu I was member 446 and  clicking the verify button didnt activate the server
i think i joined the first 500 no idea
that is a lot of spot
How do you know what number you are
the first to join the server will have the role. not the first to verify
hit me up if adding mods as well
hope you dont miss me mate  . i react to the snake icon when its only 270
Ahh oke thanks for clarifying
Selling og for .1 eth. Dm to buy
might give wl to alot of bots
Thanks for clearing this up had to wait out the 10mins before I head to bed. Looking forward to more bullish news tmr!
ShihTzu are you still manually adding OG?
yes they are adding it manually
team is adding role manually

Ty Hyxder saw this one from your retweet
Idk I think its the first day so none
in most cases og is 500 only
tbh its fine we are still early and we have a pretty good chance to get in the wl!

nice to meet you! where are you from?
Yeah its gonna be big
yea people found out QUICK
thankyou fam have a great day too
im from india brother
I wish I had found it earlier but ggs
definitely keeping eyes on this one
I think I will make it ti first 500 as I was 2 minutes and few people late once they remove the bots and also people who will not submit their wallets  but I generally think 1000 is a good number as we  as a community are at this number snd all of us are super early
i agree with that too
Dont worry there are still ways to get into the WL well announce soon.
i was late too think i got in at 800 members
I dont even know how I saw it it just popped up and I insta followed the Twitter on seeing the pixel art
I got in a bit shy of 1k

Glad im here semi early
wow the twitter is going off
Looking forward for WL annoucement!
oh wow! im from indonesia brother! nice too meet you!
Due to the Popular demand of our beloved community as we love to listen to our members we shall adjust the OGs to 1000 ... Man that would be a music to my ears... I hope theyll increase it to 1000

we are not affiliated with kaijus but we will reach out to them for a possible collab
First thing that i did after going through the server. Cannot wait for more details to fill it all up!
i can feel it in my bones
thats cool and all but whats the member number for sneakpeak 2

Insta followed when I saw the art

working on that thanks for the reminder
If you have any suggestions regarding the WL spot please let us know. Thank you in suggestions
thanks a lot for listening
we all appreciate it a lot!
There should be rage Channel where we can express specially I who missed the 500 number by 2 minutes
everything seems good imo D looking forward to see what yall hv planned
Landsm my mans! I see you modding here too
yes we are always here to listen you guys
hey fren please make sure that you guys disable webhooks and stuff in official channels there have been lots of hacks recently and I dont want to see more projects get ruined because of this
Good Evening From Philippines!
yup this is very important!
exactly bearx got hacked badly. I dont think they can recover from this
Have a nice day everyone!
BlockBots is giving out 2000 free blockbots in their raffle now
Og role looks to be filled already
I also want an OG role pls
how about first 200 who followed the twitter for og?
get back to you later guys Chill here at the Cave!
dont forget to check faqs announcements giveaways
yeah... creature toadz were able to pay off the losses because of members and because well the guy decided to give the money back for some reason but it will be hard for early projects to do that and chance of hackers giving money back again is highly unlikely
Yeah it is. Waiting for an announcement about WL for the time being
you can still try to get on the wl just keep interacting with us and vibe!
I think its over for bearx. Their mint was 0.035 u can see how much money they would hv made with 3000 mints
yes soon we will open more info about how to WL
the hacker gave money back because people discovered his binance account
wwwwww. LETS reach level 3 asapppp
feel so bad for bearx i aint even get wl but damn things were going really well up till that feels bad
is there any new announcemente for whitelist?
oh yeah forgot about that LMFAOO then mf tweeted saying it was social experiment or whatever
guysss only 6 boosts till level 3. lets do thissssss
whats the status of that now? did they actually get their mints nicked? are they still going ahead?
6 boosts only chat lets goooo
yessir im also thinking of buying one rn!!
yeah discord twitter account they were locked out of everythin the hackers even tweeted from their account that what they posted in discord wasnt a scam
Just missed OG but still happy to be here

Thank you for joining us and the rest to make this server better
we made WL? thanks man appreciate it  starwarspepe
ah yes i heard about that lmao
Daaaamn thats tough gotta make sure you remember mint dates so you dont fall for that stuff. I saw divine anarchy discord got hit last night too
Oooooo leak the requirments

yeah man fr people gotta be more cautious
WL info about to come out soon bro. lFG
Would be nice if there is a gift for early server booster haha.

The discord got hacked got about 50 pings from a bot posting about a surprise mint. They all got in a voice chat to explain what was going on though
Keep grinding you all.
it will be announced soon
daym thats such a high profile sever too

Guys a little birdie told me that with 6 boosts we can get a vanity url  can a mod verify this?
Again we are not affiliated with Kaiju but we will reach out to them for possible collab. Watch out for the next sneak peeks the wings of our wyverns will be added soon.
Digitz gang in the house eh?

Definitely exciting to see bro!
Cant wait for the wing haha
its not mandatory and provides no benefits just to clarify simply helps this server gain exclusive perks more people boost the higher the server level the higher the amount of perks
So no more OG but whitelist slot is 1500
its v fun banning spammers ngl
we will GMI because we are very early here
Ahhh gotcha thanks for explaining!

6 boosts to level 3 guys boooosttttt.

No invite competitions for this one.
Of course! Happy to hear youre doing well

Ethereum is something I dont have enough of

My man!! I slept in on my one day off this week and missed out on early wl.  Gonna kiss the dev if hell let me for a wl.  Lmao
na that guy seems like a pedofile
Oh i missed something huh
Make sure you follow Twitter  server boost if you new in here
Cosmic Wyverns CosmicWyverns
3500 Unique Wyverns. A ton of utility.
Was there a reward for early boosters?
Guys chill and relax and we will get you posted as always

Were Glad to have you here! To the MOON!
pepeCD 861689696027672586 PeepoClap
Remember 1 BREATH  1 BREATH
in the faqs it shows 2nd or 3rd week of november
nah we just like da pink flushed
guess ill ditch that venture yikes
I like it the frey is a a little
so far the OGs have been filled. Please check giveaways other spots. No invite competition will be made because we dont want to pamper our numbers. We like real community.
Be careful guys if you do not server boost you might not make it
So basically gonna be impossible
With that attitude maybe. You gotta believe!
still have a chance ser
Can you make italiano chat mamma mia
Hello happy to be here. Bummed I missed first 500 role. Snoozin lol
wuuhuuu we are going to make it
Real community is the way to go. Let the project speak for itself
Whats the plan? These wyverns
Im not gonna keep tryna win giveaways to lose
Make sure you turn off DMs from this server team wont contact you via DMs and it will save you from malicious scam DMs
I think there is still a chance for all of us
Good luck to you too fellow Space Apes!
Too many 100K member projs not even selling out lol
Wild isnt it? ETH prices didnt help for a bit there
Its the only way we know how to rock! Organic shit
yeah totally agree with this.
if these get to public sale its gonna be a big big big boy gas war
These wyverns lookin real spicy
finally no invite competition bots!
Can I send naked ladies in this server?
yessir purple gang wya??
MagnusDrake can you give us early people a better chance then giveaway
i think all should be done by WL
Bruh fr. 100k discord with 5k twitter is dumb af lol
They reserve half mint for public and half for WL
im cool with that people that join same day as public sale and act entitled wont be though Kek
how do i get whitelisted bro?
devs will announce soon
ShihTzu for most of us the giveaway isnt big enough of a chance can you do something else
Some spicy chicken ancestors fs
I bet they go with the raffle  all whitelist route. No one cares for gaswars anymore these days
I like that too. Avoid gas wars also
More and more boosters by the minute
Boosted the server  love the look of this
yes well announce something in a few hours.
Hahahaha no discord is safe from the mcchicken convo
this is eth project am i right?
so can me and my wifey Hyxder get WL starwarspepe
Get that name even longer with Wyvern maybe
ayeeee so any admins here are now here
yeah have to be careful to choose the project wisely nowdays.
Ive decided to support this project so Imma be here fam! All day errday
someone said kaijus from wish
welcome everyone waves
I feel like we are the early people even if we are not og
how to boost this server to get level 3?
organic speak it self
gas wars suck fosho i dont mind if its a really hyped project though but my TXN always seems to get lost in the mf metaverse on public sales sad
Doing good fam!!! hbu?? Are we early?
talking in this channel and chinese channel to get them mf levels
WGMI!!! we are early YES
early people will still have advantage. Always check announcements for future WL updates. For now just sit back chill and enjoy the community we have. We dont want bots here we are doing the best that we can to remove all of them.
has anyone heard of teh snail conundrum?
you can say same thing bout kaijus being kongz from wish  ppl needa chill love both projects
Me too dude. i cant compete on those gas wars fr. Id rather sleep on a project then have to participate gas wars. Or atleast just grab the floor
we want some announcment yes
Love that.. I know its hard.. I just missed the OG role for Bear X.. was there for the whole 10 days entered all the comps thousands of messages and community building never got noticed. I dont know if I have it in me again
we gotchu. were rewarding active members also. just need to be patient. i have the mods listing those who are genuinely helping each other here in discord.
861688761661652992 7  2
gotta grind whatever whitelist requirements coming up and you should be good fam
Just chill for now dude. Mangus said info coming in a few hours

Love a responsive dev team
Wow ok thanks for the opportunity for all of us
Thats the way to go buddy. I have a good feeling Imma be seeing alot of you here. Lets do this together fam
love the direction the devs are going for discord growth. Organic growth still speak for itself bet this will gain traction just from word of mouth.

Welcome man! Glad to have you here
I love this stage of the projects when the roots are growing to build the base
I boost servers I intend to diamond hand les go
community is everything. aside from the awesome utility of course.

The giveaways is the only way for a whitlist at the moment every one
We dont want 100k people in discord and ending up not minting on launch day. We are hands on and will make sure that active members gets rewarded. LFG Wyverns!
Damn wish you were earlier I might made it daddy
Your freak looks fire with dem goggles yo.
yeah fr i been in too many projects that just be telling their members to delist and shit all that time and not doing something that actually boasts organic growth feels refreshing
This is some serious alpha guys dont miss it
ErniETH hey frens!! Glad to be here and plan on staying until I get my toddler this afternoon
at least 5k by tomorrow it seems
thats good respect that
Great thinking as well not teasing too many legendary from get go

Hi Fren! roadmap just released check it out!
Everyone give a round of applause for ShihTzu
yes Brohter!! always helpful in all the servers ur in
In light of the recent hacks we are fully wary of those that we give roles to. First of all we got an awesome dev that ensures that these scams and hacks are lessened. The admins know each other personally and we will be handpicking the mods and carefully reviewing their access on this server. We have learned from the mistakes of previous projects and wont let this happen on our server.
 9 861689696027672586 3
Lots of hyped project get hack.. maskbyte was the first one
Welcome! Check out faqs and roadmap

As soon as wyverns turned up the lions started to run

kaiju started the trend lol
hopefully no scam scam around here
trust the Devs knw what they are doin  lets stick w the project
ShihTzu will we be getting more sneak peeks today?
i am sure there will be people trying to scam but the best we can do is educate everyone and prevent it
we put our trust on the team tht they have setup good preventive measures!
If you guys have questions our moderators are always there to assist you. For now just chill and enjoy the ride. Breeeeeeaaaaaattthhhhh!!

Cosmic Wyverns CosmicWyverns
3500 Unique Wyverns. A ton of utility.
Im excited for the Events
Whats the story on that
From what Ive seen so far mod team and devs just need to stay away from random linksnitro drops and verify that the person they are dming is not an imposter mod
its so cool ... i want one of these cosmic wyverns
Wonder what the WL requirements will be
we crossed checked all the members who got in first. The bot had errors in assigning the it so we have to do it manually. Please see announcements. Thank you.
JayK  yoo hello fellow Kaiju holder...
everyone make sure u put notifications on for the twitter!
Damn we got ryandcrypto in the house
ShihTzu appreciate the transparency boss!!
yeap sent a DM to him and HE LISTENS!!
you were late to the party my guy
my man here is a big influencer surely first 1k people OG is reasonable isnt bro kevinsusanto ?
dont give out whitelist when im asleep lol
has that been announced?
It was first 500 right?
so late for the party!!!
Yeah Ive heard that too but BearX didnt use 2step verification so issues
Gonna get CryptoGorilla in here
a project like this dont need influencers lol
the party hasnt even started dw
Dont worry sooner or later  the wyvern master will announce the WL requirements
If you are looking for more mods me and my friend are interested and weve modded on a good amount of projects and have references. Prayge ShihTzu
can we do 1500?? please
Oof thats a lot of work thanks for your efforts!
when new wl requirments
Cool. Just happy to be in semi early!
Just gotta be active  potentially something for us boosters
btw ShihTzu we got ryandcrypto might want to hook him up in d project. the guys a legend
we have 1500 whitelist spots to be given away soon. just need to be patient.  we dont want this to run by hype only. we want a real community
got it thanks rank 2 in the server so hopeful
hey ShihTzu how can i get in touch with you the team directly
you pointed me to an empty FAQ bro lmao
gotchu my guy good organic growth
and we dont need influencers imo
Take it easy bro. We aree just getting started
i can see it idk why you cant
I wish theres no Invite contest  levelup ranking contest....
Ill be on until I get my daughter and back when she goes to bed lol
Restart your discord !
nothing like 100 organically grown community
holy so many people now
Oh so I am not included in the whitelist
this is more like it!
thats so damn good most projects run just by paid shill posts
it was less than 400 lmao
Yes and we will exponentially keep on growing
faqs More whitelist details will be announced soon.
probably more requirements? hmm
i can assure you there will be no invite contest.
Bet youre glad you got in early fren!
ShihTzu Got a proposal for you guys sent you an invite request
Glad to hear incredible work guys
This is the wyvern way!
that worked! Thank you
The way of the Wyvern Master
This will help keep our community organic and close PESHeart
Lets go frens! 1500 WL to give out and not even that many members yet! WGMI!
Thats good to hear as Im new to all of this
cheers to many more people ahead of us wine
i hope we can grow  but not too fast
for organic growth this can be considered real fast sheesh
zoomy zoom zoom to the OG spot
hows it going glad i made it here semi early
Welcome! Checkout faqs and roadmap
Bear X had that problemthey grew too fast
I wanted to put that gif ahahhaha
great minds think alike
so hypeeeeed mann! lets goooo hows everyone doing?
I saw people suggesting first 1k OG hope u can get 1 too bro its reasonable i guess
it was all the frustrated people who couldnt get a kaiju pouring in i mean totally expected honestly
I dont know how they hack the tweeter? Maybe inside job
They forgot to take a BREATH
hacked the mods computer
thanks fam! But Im chill so fcukin early rn Ill get a spot one way or another haha just staying and help build the community
what are kaiju? i only can hear wyverns in my ears
Vaansh where r u frm?
I believe the hack happened because one of the bear x mods fell for a discord nitro scam
we dont even have 1500 people in here et
hahhahaha... thats a good one
not sure either. i only know wyverns
Group is growing hella fast
i dont think im the first 1000 to join bruh
But how did they hack tweeter?
oh ok perfect maybe his keyboard bugged
Hope evryone get whitelisted
got the mod to download an exe
By weekend? Maybe sooner???
Wyverns are fkin sick keen on more sneek peaks in the future
frustrated BearX people might ape in here
gotta grind fo that supply really low!
Well i have no idea..but scammers are for real!
i hope i will get a girlfriend sorry wrong chat
OKHotshot.eth NFTherder
.bearXNFTs Discord just got hacked and is sending out fake announcement to a scam mint site  Be careful Spread the message  Live scam active
So Communication is the only way?
excited to see more sneak peaks
Yup should get there pretty easily

yeap hahaha its gon get filled VRY soon tho
We are early hope they consider that
i need to know jpegsfnf girls
So u think its inside job?
yeah its gonna be fast AF
and we are extremely early 9469PepeCowboyShoot
yeah bearX should have closed the server when they hit 10k
First 1k OG verified and 1K General WL sounds like a good plan
More than 1k cant say early
how is your day so far
Awesome roadmap is up!
the most is 15k members
No  it was a reckless MOD who downloaded a malicious file and hacker took over server and sent out stealth mint link
How your day everyone
Keep on breathing Guys!!!
Dont know man..i cant get wl if that happen
Taking a BREATH every now and again
yeap 100 agree with this

How can I get OG or WL
guys remember to drink eat and do stuff that every human being does so this message is pretty useless but pls read it anyway
og was for first 500 only whitelist announcement will be posted soon
u gotta brooo. nice place to get nft news
Worse part is that the team of bearx was only gonna earn 130 total eth and now they will hv to reimburse everyone
we kept telling the devs to close it...3700 mints for 80k members is a disaster waiting to happen....
Nice..i was part of the server did not fall for it
yeah ive love to be an OG
wait for the next announcements
i missed the OG for like a 100 haha
scammers the worst mfs
Ok brother im waiting for the whitelist
I guess we are to late

Haha yeah its crazy what can happen if you take a break or fall asleep
i got  the WL for 3 invites only
its impossible to keep rank I believe jst b active and helpful and ull get there
too bad yt cant shut down that bot
do NOT ride the ostrich
brehh u got diamond hands. I need the liquidity so I sold 1. I shouldve bought back when it was around 0.5 haha
anw I think I really need to sleep seeya fuys later
oh shit that is a goose
i really like these pixelated projects but im always late ahah
nah thats a wyvern bruh
cant wait for the WL announcement
I feel that good stuff dude
I think it might be an ostrich?
yea but imo it was a bit risky minting at 0.5 but profit is profit
We all are like this rn!
bearx still got hacked ?
Bro I cant believe people really got scammed like that smh
Yesss sir. The mod for bear x was thirsty for discord nitro and fell for a scam
see you bud have a good night
i wonder what the 11 wyverns gonna look like triplemonkas
rightttt so many too!
yooo Dexter hows ur lab going?
they are gonna be super sick guarenteed! Cant wait to see
Yeah would love to get a sneak peek on those
when someone play island boys songs
nah. they all G. owners took over again. ready to reimburse the ones that got scammed and ready to rebuild. I have faith in Akeem
I am happy at least we can communicate here! In some grp 2min slowmode still can keep up!
fr kaiju kongs etc had really nice moving ones
Its actually insane that it works  then they get their Twitter and its just all down hill
hope gas wont be this high during mint
Shox is on  lets goooo broski
lmao yo those guys came outta nowhereee
Kaiju has shenron which is dope
haahajhahha nice meme
yeah they really did!
can i still be an OG haha
im thinking they do will this raffle omfg i cant do this anymore whitelisting stuff hahah
yeah fr they had tons of cool ones hope we see similar here dance3
gas can kill a project launch
and they stole my heart
first 500 only unfortunately
DAW is minting rn but it is selling fast
this is gonna be hugeee
Yeah some animation ones will do wonders
they real funny no cap
yeah 350k worth of ETH... unreal man
the first 500 members
animated ones have to be one of ones
still pushing for top 1500 hahahaha
or the opposite high gas usually leads to high floor especially for hyped projects
I have been waiting for so many years! Finally will be able to kill again!! Muhahaah
for sure thats why projects should start putting in more work to avoid them
that would be insane hopefully we get a good chane at whitelist at least
begging for OG at 1500
Yah  ... This will become hyped soon. Just watch ... Slow mode is in play now. So we can make some friends and move to other slow channel.
anyone know why gas been so high the last 2 days
I cant believe that many people fell for it. shows us that so many ppl in this space have no idea what they are doing
Hey guys if you have any questions or need help always feel free to dm me
I think most or half supply is gonna go to whitelistogs though 500 supply already reserved for OGs
Gas wars are so bad only bots which frontrun the buy get them early
a lot of alt coins coming back
like wtf i miss 50 dollar gas fees
What is your favorite color?
better to whitelist the 1800....
never post this again fren
no gas war on that idea......
basically just make sure you get whitelist or things are gonna be much harder
Thanks Kishu! will divert any unanswered Qs to you
project looks extremely promising!
Thank you Ser! Good choice  also my daughters!
Sure man my dms are always open!
what meka number is yours?
Raffle or some other system would be good.
Leave some feedback for the boy SLAKE made some nice fanart earlier
Hey bro! I see you in a lot of decent projects! you really have an eye for these things haha
Dutch auctions are fairest IMO
better mekaverse or wyverns?
Wyverns are awesome!!! really really want one
meka ass pls dont compare
this is also a good option. but it still got some form of gas war no?
Yeah Dutch auctions are decent
the words no gas war makes me orgasm a bit
true... but hopefully not like mekaverse
something just happened with my friends bro wtf. I hv to go for a few hours
samee man i want at least 2
Heiwa yes but only when the price gets low. Better to bid right above lowest price bc youll end up paying the same in gas at floor price
Haha yeah meka verse was just playing the lottery
But i am falling behind! Cant concentrate two things at the same time!
Did you win the meka raffle or sweeped the floor?
that one was over hyped
Yeah the whales will happily get in at a higher price and the rest have a good opportunity as price drops
you can sweep the floor now
especially if they announce breeding or something!
No worries brother .. you will be good
Hey guys new here any idea on how to get to the WL?
I bet they woulddd. I already want to see some baby wyverns lol
Will be hard enough to get 1 sad
Yep  I got my Boonji at .3 but ended up paying .15 in gas lol.
faqs further infos will be announced soon
Gotta swap that realquick!
Nothing announced yet they will have something soon
gotta be helpful and engaging EZ
no announcement yet just the first 500
no info yet fam. more announcement coming later today
yeah it would be so fitting!
mexicanpepe mexicanpepe mexicanpepe
i hope they come up with something a little more unique than breeding. its just been done too many times. really gotta put our thinkinh caps on and figure out something BRAND new
Thanks a lot guys. that was helpful! gonna checkout faqs
soon to be worthless... might bid at .2 eth
Thats very cheap gas considering how much hype that project had
yeah that would be sweet hope so!
im sure they have more unique additional utility planned else it would have been announced already
It was only like 50 at .4 though so wouldve been cheaper to buy then instead of floor
Idk the future cant comment either.
i think i saw somewhere the rarest ones hadnt revelead yet is this still the case?
thats not too bad tho I think considering the porject
or they just dont have a plan yet haha
same then i paper handed
they already have established the plan
Staking and supporting shelter dogs  take my ETH!
hey glad to be here how you doing bud
Gas wars are nuts lol
Roadmap is a little sneak peek. I am sure they have bigger things planned
Where is everyone from?
yeah too early to tell
so fun when txn gets lost
I dont have a lot of faith in Boonji tbh
true but they pump the project lol
Doing great ma man! same here pumped on this project
this is interesting though  Collaboration and partnerships with other blockchain games. We already have one partnership with a blockchain MMORPG which will utilize our native token as part of the whitelisting and presale process hint hint!
Yooooo dude congrats on mod!
Yea I like this one. different from other for sure
My ape might do well
lmao my bad i meant i barely broke even
same here man i hope i can get wl cause i know it will be insane
not exactly sure what it entails but its interesting
Trust the process bro you got this
i dont dislike the art
not sure didnt follow it anymore after the raffle
nah wyverns will do better than all the nfts yall mentioned bruh
Yeah the utility is interesting for boonji
cant wait for the reveal! Hope I pop a couple of rares!!
Hahaha. I already sold mine for .68. Their Insta only has like 330 followers  and for a project like that youd think more Insta people would be on it
boonji is a long term hold for me. i genuinely just like having it in my collection lol
sup dude! welcome to the cave
fosho best of luck man
but we need to say that soltimber
hey my man! how u doin
Great day Im sure for you and the team! project looks really promising
yep. we already have one partnership. open beta is in january
you too G! just under a couple of hours left now
we going to be straight lfg
im guessing we hit 2k by tom
Just checked out faqs but its empty
arts too dope not to attract pixel lovers
feelin good fam looking forward to what yall have in store pray
I think earlier maybe. things gonna spread like wildfire!
instructions will be announced soon!
Evening for me as well
Easy more than that pretty sure
Almost 1500 members already dance3
i think well hit it later today
Haha you could do it at 1.4 ... Bad choice.
Yah it will team is working hard rather than sleeping afte selling.
this is just the beginning!
Nice !! Time to grind eat  and go bed ahah
forgot to send u the link
ive seen this before hope the devs are ready
Wild. Its going to boom overnight at this rate haha
bet we hit it within an hour
Im very excited to be helping out in a mod role for sure Prayge
i think lot of people gave up after OG spot was taken up
Ay yay yay hoder! Ill rejoin for u
I wanna see more wyverns lol
eyoo fried chicken mates
I invested in a project thats already yielded me 30 ROI since then. Ill buy back in if I see more progress
I can imagine! would be a very exciting position to be in! Best of luck to you
should have been faster
diamond hand as always i really trust this project also i participied in the ama
Are they randomly generated??
yeah! growth is gonna be exponential. Hopefully things are manageable
anybody have more samples of what this nft looks like??
but you are in time to love me
ohhhh were neighbours! D
Arent wizards supposed to always be on time
mochimochihellowhitemochimochi
whaaat ahahaha lets talk in italy chat so

Im from Switzerland bro but I speak a bit of italian
lets petition for first 1500 OG status
Excited to this project
Wow u naughty friedchicken
hey was in this group before 300 people still not whitelisted
All good we both early enough time to earn the goodstuff
i think u gotta dm one of the mods with proof
Drop it in suggestions bro but it will be  WL not og for the 1500
Dont worry my friend
Just always be updated in this channel
Fried Chicken!! Im craving you now
well at the pace were going... i dont expect a public mint.... all wyverns are going to be whitelist minted
more mods are getting added?
They already know how big this going to be. Preparing for the inevitable
good to see all the mods hanging out!
haha my thoughts exactly
just wishing... but will follow whats devs decide
 Moderator i was in top 500 and i didnt get OG role
gotta be ready for when the waves of ppl start pouring in
pretty good! Not as good as the OGs but we here now
thats kinda rude bruh
Just trying to balance work and my secret NFT life haha.
All the best for all!
Have they announced how to get whitelist or not yet
Yah bro ama seems promising. Hope for the best.
It could yeld you more than 100 that was a bad timing bro. That was my point.
did i miss the whitelist lol

What are you craving? I might make burgers
Why do I hear this in vegeta voice

.50 eth and gas fee how muxh??
bro why!!!! I already had dinner and now im craving junk again!!!
I am getting hungry myself
05 eth... if they suddenly change it to 0.10 and tell ya they have a surprise mint.... you know what that means....
no idk what that means? haha
Aint no surprise mints lol never believe it
did you manage to mint?
people way too gullible too it sucks to see
that they are being hacked
What mint is going on?
If a bot starts spamming about a surprise mint its a hack never believe it
Means the discord got hacked never mint from a bot message the owners will put out announcements themselves
with art this good... hype is real... you cants top the flood of pixel lovers
hey mate glad you joined this will be a good project
no because im noob doing these trivia drops hahah
Hii all nice to see u guys
dunno about mint but boonji reveal gonna happen in a few hours
Gotta spread the word and protect the community
I am worried how many people will get scammed once opensea nft is released
Thank u for the greetings
we can chat in here italy
its a scam....if they do that... dont mint
worst part is most people on the bearx whitelist think the team shouldnt refund anyone and expect the project to do good that way
Thats why we spread the word and look out for each other
Yeah gotta have ur homies
wow cool red kaiju ser
yeah fr so dumb. creature toadz got money back so thats why they could new project cant just shit out that much sad
me when you....me snd you when...
wasnt it more than 70 eth taken
the hacker did the project quite bad man
damn teaming up is the move for those kind mints
i have no idea all i know is that its alot of money
yeah my group was dead and no infos ahahah
yea was a project with sky high potential PESSadGe
oh im 20 do you watch twitch?
its how the japanese dude in Godzilla pronounces Godzilla
hello cave ppl hello Zamorano
maybe they recover it post this lets see
Yeah I feel bad for the people who put countless hours to get wl
not that much anymore I used to watch a lot of streamers but I kinda fell off
yeah art was great... but got too big too fast
yoo thanks for joining
still the owner apparently has a punk so if hed like to regain some public trust thats what they should imo
Kishu Yo i swear i see you modding everywhere bro lmao
oh hey mate are u the one who can speak italian?
i got lucky i teamed up with some smart ppl
We at 1500 Wyverns fam!
Yeah that name is very familiar
I like your name mate haha
yeah now its useless
same dude send link in dms   love ya
oh rip  do you know by chance chrislaway? he is a sort of switzerland twitch streasmer that speak italian haha
i get that a lot ahah
better for wyverns all hype go here now ooga
lots of crappy project out there... there is literally a Crap nft!!!
i think this one will be one of the top NFTS for november
Anything can be an nft

 bookin a flight ticket rn
MagnusDrake ShihTzu one last ping to you guys would like to talk briefly about a proposal i think youll enjoy.
Galactic Apes Space Apes Cyber Kongs Bear X
exactly thats why i didnt manage to get the wl and i discovered it too late
big and juicy exactly how i like my meat
franco sempre a farci riconoscere
0.05 ETH to be precise
a burger sounds fire too lmao
very nice! thank you for info
oh i wasnt talking about borgor
yeah its on a dumping floor now hopefully it goes back up later
not losing hope on that one... im OG ther... top 100
where is the ethereum network??
this one i noticed late... missed the boat on OG in this one
you have to be happy you have an ape as pfp
whats the link to mint this on mint day??
its becoming harder to keep hope when all the whitelist talks is how no1 should be refunded or increase mint prices tbh
have devs gotten everything back under control in discord?
Its the first day of the discord all that will come
the website is still under construction
They already get back now
Oh did they? Thats good is it looking alright?
yeah I get you. what about here is the wl method known yet?
hopefully i get wl bc if i dont ima have to break the bank to buy secondary
they still havent discussed last nights hack
basically just active no invite bs
not my kaiju hah. i screen shot
just be active and helpful...
the most costefficient way to acquire an nft!
I hope everybodys doing fine. Keep safe!
The creator want to compensate everyone that got scam
cause i like kaiju and i cant afford it hhh
Ahhh the old right click save
thanks man your name does look familiar
the good old right click and save XD
right click save is op
Community is popping I love it

Good ol right click and smash
hopefully when you get a wyvern you can use that

gapes are so awesome... its what started my obsession with pixaleted art
lets make geesy goose project
Sadge moment nearly as sad a butterfree
u gotta be on pc to save gifs
Depends if the team decides first 1000 people OG or still 500 but theyll have general WL goodluck
861687613069328394 2

Yea i hope theres like unique ones too
Hell yeah lets make it happen
blobDance 2 861687613069328394 2
man youre really a visionary. I barely scraped up a regular gape. trying to make a crew now so that I can be ready for the missions
yeah i agree although some kaijus were so badass
usually its only metamask
The charizard kaiju was wet
Im assuming metamask  since its ETH
they made charizard kaiju what hte heck?
metamask or coinbase??
mletter eletter T1 A1
Yeah but idk if they minted it
i want a yellow wyvern so it can look like pikachu
metamask would probably better to use
Will it be on immutable x!?!?!?!?
yes that one is insane
cant go wrong with metamask
How do people find out about these things on the day of lol
I want a cute aqua blue one
metamask easier but protection sucks. no 2fa either
Homies from Digitz NFT share alpha all the time thats how I got here
was a bit late already for this one.. really aped on octohedz.....you can also check out race apes....its made by one of the OG galactic apes
Metamask is best for NFTs rn IMO
Shhh thays a secret place
Thats how I found it just popped up on the TL lol
Blue body and a yellow scales like the inside body thing
Cant share all the secrets haha
thats the wyvern dream
idk wtf i want for wyvern. just make it look good haha
Make sure you serverboost!
I wanna be on that secret place too plss. Lolol

when you BREATHE youve conquered the world

We are so early too. I feel that this community will be special
might have to move to other channels hard to keep up in this chat lmao
what is wagmi lol i always see it
i 100 agree...but some people only think in dollar signs and greed gets the better of humans
Boooo. Sweet and salty man it works
Nah bro. Just go sleep. Healthy come first
we should all appreciate the organic convo right now before bots start raiding PESSadGe

I am very Indian but live in Canada now

hows the weather over there bro?
Hyxder hes coming for u
Yeahhhhh this happen to me again i do this at last project but they have target
he can try but am not going anywhere
Wyvern fam we are going to the moon no doubt
yeah way too hard to get...
oh damn! we gotta stay super active now!!!
1 minute slow mode now chat gonna move slow lol
hard to top you bro... im happy to place in 2nd
oh amazing i just got here a few years ago but food is unlike anything ive ever eaten !
Mr. AK its getting cold now bro. so cold.
wow one minute cooldown
I got lucky on launch night
1 minute slow mode is good ! hahaha
Ah haha yeah thats fair I wonder if they announce it like in a week so we all turn into zombies here by then lol
nah fam not the food gifs
Hyxder ur pfp kinda looks like fat charizard
cant sleep now hmmmmpepocloseasf
i think im at 11 lets get it. wait slow mode for 1 minute now. gotta be active on all discussion board then
Do we get ranked up for boosting the discord? ive never boosted before but i think its time
can somebody dm me when we got the exact date and site for this mint? i would greatly appreciate. i am an old man and not very tech savy
Do u know meta legends?
  got to make sure you eat somehow
Can you believe that there was a shopping in Brazil that had a TON of them? Idk how
NOOOO please bring it down to at least 30 seconds i was actually tryna talk here sadhug
where all the grinders at now?
Can anyone solve Im white round but not always around? And from what movie??!!
Wowwww haha very lucky man!
Just talk more slowly
12 hours a day is like. 2400 xp a day
i think slow is better so we cant avoid spams and have a meaning full convo.... hard to keep up with so many people in one channel
yes sir you at 11 right now. keep it up!
so actually got confused by the ranked up? is it about rank or is it about being top 100 leaderboard cause he said that 1500 will be whitelisted now its already 500 wl then 1000 slot still open
I cant follow this chat haha
ifkr man 1 minute slow mode is very painful  FriedChicken  LEGENDS OMG i left that server it was way too hard to get WL man but i am really regretting not doing it early
cant see the roadmap !
sadge bruh my stomach is growling real hard Dead
bro chill! thats the Wyven lmfao
Well worth the no sleep lol
slowmode too long  Im tryna catch up with my old buddy hikesder I think thats how you pronounce it lmao
Some are here some are probably at hapebeasts
there will be more chances to get wl this is just the first
How is everyone doing?
The chat aint that fast
about to smash that level 3    try n keep up
Yo this is turtle mode
Where are u guys from  all of you?
we are gonna make it please gib us tips and tricks to become top 5
nice to see so many server boosters
how does hape list work???
or should I say  Chubbyzard? lmao
Its great have 1 minute timer thats our time to get exp constanly i reach level 30 at meta legends took me 7 days to reach it
make a server booster chat pls which is more free to chat in
change to 30 seconds pls
yap the first to get white list is to kill each other by winning the leaderboard
Damnnn haha shouldve bought a couple and brought them back lol
there should be multiple snapshots so therell be different people in each of every snapshot therefore an increase in whitelisted members as well hmmm
the WL spot until when??
Yeah I know haha at least its not 5 minutes yet  grinds are always hard
7 days ok good timeframe i wonder when this contest will end
We are wyverns not turtles
there is no exact date snapshot will be taken at random pray
i dont think turtles fly bro
not sure all i know is that theres 1.5k available spots
cooldowns also vary. it wont be 1 minute everytime
Yeah thats why theyve mentioned it might be one or it might be multiple
they not gonna say until when man. so we just keep at it
Canadian here  great country
Yeahhh they should tell us when this contest end..
They like to keep us on our toes those devs
keepin us on our toes
no this is easier to moderate for the team. Relax trust me this is way better
that random snapshot its would be so worry
okayy thanks for the information sir !
Well apparently they are choosing the most active members there randomly. At least thats what I understood. Probably some competitions as well will be.
yeah its going to need a 1 min timer when more people start joining haha
yea so you gotta be active 247
So all canadian here?? Mostly
Grind until the end of time
We need more sneak peaks sir
imo the timer is a bit too long the conversation kinda gets lost lol
its already a 1 minute timer LOL 5 minutes is the one which is gonna hurt apparently i believe the guy who told me though
W 9  4  3 861687615769673738
Yoo bro  waaaazzzzzzzzup
haha just what I was gonna type!
usa ! canada better though lol
youll get it when you least expect it.
its a great system imo. to deter those who just wanna spam.
kinda like metalegends
lets go fight the leader board my friend
Damn. Aint nobody got time for that
what happens if im always expecting it
will be 10K members in 8 hours
I made some spicy ramen now Im gonna be breathing fire like a wyvern gang wish me luck
which is pretty tiring honestly sad
mekaverse had a 30 min timer and the chat kept popping off
you have to sleep some time
for sure kinglove do you guys also have 11s planned for the collection? would really love to see those in the future
ser will OG wyverns open up to 500?
Dang guys can we put slowmode to 15 sec or 30 maybe 1 minute is a pain
cant wait to see those!
W 4 PoggersRow 5  3 toadzdisco 2
Theyre more expensive there Im gonna wait ahaha
yo legendddd good to see you here man. checked the announcements ?? we gonna LFG or what
mekaverse had no whitelist though did they?
good luck everyonedogrollypolly
30 seconds would be great
they had 80k members or 100k .... thats bound to happen....
nah i dont think so AShmm
30 seconds would be prime.
Yes this 1 minute is a pain in the a
we are counter checking those OGs who sent their wallets with the ones we gave the roles. after 24 hours well assign additional OG roles to complete the 500
Ohhh gotcha. yeah id wait too then lol
Its hard to have conversations
speaking of meka....whos in hor1zon? art looks even better imo
hey mr. wyvern you got 2fa on right? lmao
will it be according to order of entrance?
then grind here would be a great opportonitty to get the
Gotta pick one person and just continuously respond to each other lol
everybody needs to be on 2fa !
exp is  minute ! 1 minute slowmode is good i think
Mekaverse floor is dumping tho
Took me 15 hours straight to get WL
yeah i guess its less tiring
And another fanart BongoCatAss
Yea lol its very hard to keep up a conversation with 1 minute slowmode
looking forward to it! I did kinda cut it close haha
shout out to them for actually having different backgrounds
Sounds good! its one thing to join early but another to be active early on. Maybe this can be considered
we are gonna make it! the cool downs decreased!! yay
Thats the only way haha
I like the 3500 supply
Are there aNy sneakkeeks
It was too hype and the commons all looked the same ruined it for a lot of people
Just the one in sneakpeek
no spammer here bcs the slowmode is 1 min
Ser does that mean i might stand a chance xD
I hv to write a paper and complete a 10 page assignement today night gonna be chatting all night ahhahahhaa
Yes jungle freak is better
This is a very interesting project  everyone here just know how early you are! this discord was made today lol
i wonder if there is gonna be breeding for the wyverns   speculation guys?
I mean everybody saw that coming. Mekaverse was easy money
for sure. 3500 is a solid number to go for provides more value to the holders and can be good for implementing utility.
hor1zon gonna take over meka definitely
for sure. some just joined and eventually left we are checking this all manually
U have jungle? I miss that project damn
Okay... so we got a WL up
Selling rank 3000 Wyvern under floor. 5 ETH. DM me
Thanks for the fairness
So this is an xp grind then?
these 10k projects are gettin old even though were early lol
i get WLed there haha
bro I didnt see you today while we were dealing with the whole bearx thing. were u around?
thats how you build a strong community
art definitely looking better for hor1zon too late for me to get WL there though TT
the mod says whitelist announcement shortly is it the WL from twitter?
hey you have joined as well
mekaverse was rigged sadly I cant believe devs did that
so 1 breath 1 dollar?
kind of. its mostly about good contribution but top 100 will recieve WL as well
Love this. Thank you for being a real one
yes man it is sad what happened
Easy money when you flip
Dang I have zero chance now. Good luck guys! May the person who chats forever endlessly get rich!
no fiat here  1 breath1 breath
Hey Lesush.. Yea im liking the look of this project.. although this cd timer is gonns get to me I know it
ShihTzu until when we must at top 100?
I like how thicccc these wyvs look
I think of it as a community bonding session
yeah I tend to disagree but Im here for it
Great to hear. Thank you
whats your pfp ? looks cute
kinda but not really. the team put in measures so that its not manipulated by spammers. not bad imo
I hate 10Ks tbh too much saturation
it was all about luck lol
where did the mod say that? theres been an announcement about whitelist if you go and look its top 100 active members but the contest has a secret end date
reveal the devs knew which meka had what rarity before reveal. the rare ones were bought for 23 eth above floorbefore reveal
This community is purely organic. This is the way
you are far from late! its not a grind contest. no invite contest here. just hang around a little here and there
are we gonna make it bois

Best Peaky Blinders character is Solomons
Peaky blinders is a great show def a must watch
well get through all the seasons brudda helpinghand
just dont stop watching if you find the first ep too boring
baki tokyo revengers are some of my favorites
The coincidence of us both being on this project is kinda crazy its like our friendship is meant to be bro Mendez

i have not peaky blinders seems like a cool show though
so hyped for the next season man cant wait
I just started the Sopranos
Cosmic Wyverns will make waves!
peaky blinders is insane
Hyxder is my bestie 4L
ngl his accent is so distinct even if tries to switch it up! so good on most of the characters he played tho!
You honestly have to regardless of what people sayi
TR been on the list for a minute..might have to start it soontm
yeaa man wyverns gonna storm all the bearss
yeah the first ep doesnt put me off had that with a lot of shows but they end up being really good
Do you prefer watching it in original? I guess we kinda used to everything being always dubbed here in Russia for us so we are not very aware of the difference
tokyo revengers goated u should definitely watch it
you watched taboo? only 1 season tom and his dad wrote it and tom is the main character its unreal
Cant wait for it either been waiting so long

Why wyverns will be 25 ETH floor by the end of October
1. Most hyped NFT project of all time. World record volume on launch. Crashed Opensea.
2. Highest quality art with the best branding and scalability potential in the entire NFT space.
3. Once wyverns start selling for 1000000 these will become a status symbol and FOMO will kick in hard for whales and influencers. Especially with Twitter official verification.
4. The devs are doxxed experienced and have endless resources to do whatever they want and incorporate all the best ideas previous projects have used.
5. ETH is headed for 8k10k EOY meaning NFTs will have a massive influx of money coming in.
6. The mostviewed bored ape ever has 50k views. A random unrevealed wyverns already has 33k. wyverns has 210k twitter followers. Bored ape has 180k.
7. Only 1.5 of wyverns are listed below 25 ETH.
8. Coinbase is adding NFTs so 70000000 new wallets will be introduced into the space.
This things moving too fast Im trying to reply haha
wowww nice analysis mannn

makes it more interesting to see how it changes in 6 hours
I mean what are you doing with your life if you dont know? Jk jk
Good thing Im at ten right now
If it was any other system it would be fair but this way someone will suck up to the mods and team for today then bounce after being listed just dosnt make sense tome
Oh I thought you were from Europe for some reason  I am from Russia Moscow. Our time zone is really different then haha
hehehe what u doin heree
no bots they will be checking
Man the past couple days was crazy with big discord servers getting hacked
yea im definitely gonna have to hop back onto it loved the first season
i dont think so this looks like a HQ project
We hit 1600  keep inviting your friends over lets get it popping even more we have a long way to go
anyone here from indonesia ??
when the bots do come in here pls make sure the early grinders are rewarded
probablyy havin fun chattin with them
Yeah agreed man it will dip as they always do and then bounce back 2x stronger
damn my man is number 1
no no the devs gonna do smthng about it.
Just curios lol they make me twice as busy
If you were here yesterday during the first few hundred people the whitlist felt like a possibility but not this this seems impossible

we all put in mad work in here lessgoooo
Ah I couldnt watch it tbh. Did you enjoy it?
depends on what u put in really hahaha. I had 67mil and i cutlossed at 0.000007 my average was 0.00001 to get into NFTs.  A decision that i would do again if i can go back in time. Still got more profits in doing this than holding shib haha. The story is different when u got 500M or over 1B tho like when u got in really really early. Now thats a lot of money
yessir we going a long way here
Just hold tight. Dont get caught up in the hysteria. Shib will change some lives
Yah ... Lot of known faces ... How was your day?

yup hasan managed to mint like 300 toadz cause of a bug with contract. The dev for creature bought most of it from him.
Bro you are ranked like 20 out of 100. Ez game
Doing great class got cancelled sunglassesvery3dcool
what project are you talking about
Just got to do my best to continue being top of the 100 today by any means necessary
thats the move nowadays i swear
Yep so NFTs are all down. But NFTs are gonna pump reall soon whenever it goes down haha
ECHO you passed me bro
What exam you got bro?
yup 500 creaturetoadz i heard
NFTs always up bro forever
Was anyone on wl for bearx?
hasan the owner of a bot i believe
currently looking at many nfts
same my 2pm class did so i have nothing till 5
gonna grind for another 10 minutes and im gonna go to sleep
i nid one of ur pfp HAHHA
damn that guy is seriously printing money with his ransom plays
hasan just another nft guy
This one. The team is awesome while yeah getting top 100 activity not easy for many the team is fantastic I spoke with them last night and they were really nice
pretty talented dev used to develop for sneaker bots
Very smart my dream is to own a Cool Cat
bro why is botcommands on 6 hr slow LOL
pixel art is my fav gives me nostalgia
fr every 3d art project i see does horrible
No fudders in the wyvern Fam
this one blew up way too quickly lol
SRSLY HOW COME. u was on  earlierrrr keep on going bro imma pass out in a minute
Hes the guy thats been hacking into every project?
Its crazy what has happened Do you think they will recover this situation?
last night? you heard of it yesterday? how did you not get OG role? LOL
So  ppl dont just keep checking their rank... its about building community
fr smart guy he made a killing. Most people wouldnt have even spotted the issue with contract.
yeaaa wyverns gonna be stronkkkk
they want people to grind instead of just spamming to see their rank
im not sure but i think so! the discord still has hella members D
have to go back to real life for now
MonkaS not mr bogged himself
I appreciate them giving people a chance. I guess im wrong about  it so Ill just say that. I hope I make the cut. I missed it by like 50 people the chat was broken
3d art has been a huge L lately
Im done.. tommorow i willclimb up
LFG!!!! jahahahhahaha sleepy af but have to grind
Yes ... Lets see what happens..
What do you think the game will be?
been loving dragons since i was a kid
yes ofc but 6h is a while LOL
i remember thinking the price for his bot at 2e per license and 1e renewable every month was ridiculous
im doing great just grinding lfg
I guess to stop people from always checking their rank
Hey you can check it here botcommands
whats your fav emoji? type it down below!
I was not but few of my friends were. Its so crazy I this space lol
I just wanna thank the team for building this and giving us all an opportunity
Nunca o vi mais gordo
no idea really i wish its dope
proved us wrong big time haha
Like destroying a city minigame for breath
definetely pixelated art always does well
I dont know why ppl hate on it
Yea good... I asked them to turn it off completly P
You too my friend. The project looks way too promising to pass off
You manifest your own rank. For example Im rank 69.420
what time is it for everybody
lmao nice number mate
nice game. lets get to go people
i wonder what the legendary 1 of 1s are gonna look like for this project
Ill simp for this team they deserve it
i feel like most people who buy NFTs grew up in the 90s where the pixel stuff hit home
for sure it fits the pfp aspect so well doesnt have to be in such hi res
Going for a mint at 4
Youre at the top of the LB! I think top 30
omggg same time zone hahaha
Its for civil service commission overall. Its kinda weird.
its ok bros imma sleep and when i woke up i will be stuck in my RL too. so ill see u in 12 hour ish? hope that well still be on top 10. WAGMI!!
wouldnt change anything at all people still speaking to try get wl just the way it is
omggg brooo so late dyyy hahahah
97 born here!! how about u??
YES EXACTLY! thats why pixel arts where its at lmfao
Lets get it on and have those slots open for us
what country are you in
Yoo second class got cancelled today LFG
most definetly the nostalgic nfts will succeed as they strike a cord with people
If you spoke to the admins last night youd know that they are actually down to earth and care about the success of the community
get some sleep bro and grind hard tomorrow you good
will see u lot in a bit
ooo shit u from SEA? im aus D
Yeah I guess so. Are they planning on helping people out  who sent their money out to scammers?
You got this bro. Respect on the grind! Gn
Almost 4pm for me. I might be in chat for the rest of the day
Ikr getting fomo feels
you can do itttt woop woop!
hey man you remember telling me about metalegends earlier? i forgot to ask did you get WL in the end? LOL
You cant say that about projects nowadays especially in the past day did you see that lions one thats just a scam?
Yep theyve asked the WL people to vote if they want to increase mint price to help repay if not they will repay themselves
Ive been into the pixels or 3D lately
whats your sign?? im leo
So u want take a nap?
is it really a scam? i saw somewhere someone warning people not to mint what kind of scam actually?

dont give up everybody
idk i rather not look back
Keep up the good vibe guys WGMI
is that doodle in ur pfp yours?
struggling to keep my eyes awake but the grind is worth it
i was really salty about droid business. I know people got scammed left and right but suddenly accelerating the time of minting isnt really good for people in different timezone. It was like 3am for me and I decided to sleep when they said they gonna postponed for 24 hour
LFG guys 3 the community so farrr
cool pfp what project is that from?
no no imma passed out soon. if not my rl work will be a mess this morning
holy shit very nice. i sold a rank 500 for 3 SOL lmao. but quickly just to make money abck i have naother rank 500 aswell
Ah it was not for you but the guns.
Always or hold the bag lol
Yeah I hope the best for you too my friend I hope we both get what we want out of this experience whether its friends or whitlist
Cosmic Wyverns discord  rl work
Thats where we differ. I like the pain of going back and checking
yeah i probably couldve gotten more but i only got 1 so i just wanted to take profits
rank 11 right now but i needa sleep
LMAOOO nah ur dif bro

oh yeah that did suck a lot of servers dont take into account time zones especially some that are like 8 hours ahead
anyone got any projects they are looking at
Ive been trying to win one on Twitter
Liverpool rly struggling rn
anyone here going for goblin lab?
literally will as well xD
When the chat wasnt busy there was a lot of cool people I could actually have a conversation with lol but right now I guess scrolling up when I get a reply is going to have to do
they made half of users delist their droids lol im holding onto one more to see what happens.
Haha congrats bro and nice Doodle!
This project too lit man
Not sure if imma go for it not even wl either so ..
check out my meme on memes
true cant complain about the profit though
fr... the supply is too high and they arent pfps imo... supply just too high for art
Gotta keep up with the chat tho or youll lose your place lmao I woke up to get back into chat cause I was sleeping I got work soon
this is the project we want
Im happy for you bro I really want a doodles but as you said it is a lot PESAngeryCry
Damn I dont have a charger I am at 5 percent
How the notification for bearx goes today?
yep same here ugh!  im sure this  project is gonna be even better ngl.
I hope so thats why I took the risk to pay so much...lets see if I was right
anyone here care about hor1zon
im hyped ngl. love dragons
Going to be epic if eithier of us make it. Regardless keep hustling you got this
I think they fixed it finally lol it was nuts this morning haha
amazing gl with that!

Gotta keep grinding guys best of luck
wyverns arent dragons though technically
we going past the moon man
i think liverpool cn be pullingg one offf
Hopefully we both get lucky lol
u guys play any games?
fk my boonji sucks rank 5800
Where do you see your activity tho I know its in bot but how?
Its a long term hold
Yeah I am liking the things the dev have been saying. Very promising as long as they execute!
same! have you check out faqs to see how to get wld?
you shouldve just said   haha
yeah still be 00 against preston lol
make sure u guys check out faqs to learn more about WL !
i totally agree LOL dont know why there arent 250k people in their discord yet
bro why solana died today
the day will come! there are pullbacks from time to time so if you get lucky you might get a good deal
Ayyy your pfp looks familiar I remember this project hows it going rn?
frrr i lost so much  on solana
people liquidating or moving to some other crypto
I meant that different different not because you do it from home ahaha
yup im in here chillin trying to show my name
I think people just past it cus of meka idk
this! i think its gonna be amazing
Does anyone know where you can see your activity rank ? Not your level but where you stand in terms of the entire chat?
I sold mine yesterday. Sketchfest
no worries. Did you see what we posted an hour ago? Support it
LMAO that is sooo fun you ask. It was a rug pull and they dipped today i think
I agree hodl is the way to go with the doodles
meka died so fast it was crazy just a bad project
Solana mooned a lot and it stayed high asf for ages. Was bound to happen eventually
yall still early dw keep it up
It was kinda weird. Hacked both twitter and discod.
Oh yeah haha. working from home is OP
it was super over hyped no wonder
thats true but man opening phantom and seeing that red PepeHands
what should i eat for dinner now
the tiny differences in the meka project are really disappointing tbh
Literally 8 ETH to like 1.5
dam me too im trying to get wl. are you looking at any other projects?
ayeee Hyxder is back!
You got it. I will support anything you guys create haha. Being one of the 600th people to get here I hope you guys appreciate me too we are the post ogs haha
and they all look the same its obvious why it failed the roadmap was trash too
yes sir had to do sum
It was wasnt it? Who knows of course but damn no trust anywhere in these times lol
3 dont mind me just spreading some love P
i am actually there are two projects metalegends and metabullz
Thats awesome! Is all that from NFT earnings?
meka was a whole load of ass for its hype
nah I think they were just over hyped. that was on the community tbh
Dont worry Cosmic Wyverns to the rescue.
how much eth n sol u guys HODLing?
imagine it actually went up to 8 ETH floor OMG
Damn I was about to mint but I was outside so I didnt. Right after that they oversold and nightmare happened
I hope you are right
bro i always tag obama in twitter giveaways hope he wins one
yeah its crazy influencer pnd
yessir gonna save us all
most of their mods scammed through the project as well
Someone said Im rank 20 out of 100 not sure if thats true or not
Need one of these babiesss
meta bullz? i think im in there too. do you have wl??
metalegend is hard loll
wyverns is gonna moon i rly like the community here
rule 1 dont have dumbass mods
Wasnt it really not random at all? Saw a tweet about how rare ones were pseudo handpicked by those close to the team or some shii like that
completely agree the way so many looked the same was laughbable
lmao im a mod bro what r u saying
yeah it was a rug. . .  hopefully i get wl for this server and get that bread
you guys worked on any other projects or keeping it downlow? edit   oh wait I just realised youre not a dev
Hey guys just found out about this proj. Happy to be here
If so thats awesome lol I guess I was really active during the og thing last night so I got my time in. If anyone knows how to check what number in rank you are in terms of activity let me know
most definetely thats why this project gonna do well
Idk but their raffle was sick... Most of the community member who were there from the beginning could not get it.
igot a wl for it cant wait for release!
mods here seem rly chill and dope !
this seems interesting
meta bullz? never heard of it any good? how big is the discord
eh im sure mods in here are amazing
Yeah this project going to be huge I can see it already
Lol mods build the community
the community also seems awesome
whats your pfp it looks dope
chillin and vibin here haha
yeah team here has been solid so far else i would not be sticking in chat long
keep the vibe up guysss
definitely i think the same
omg yeah i do! cant wait for that one to drop as well wbu do you have any nfts you looking at?
Yah .... We should be more careful .
giving me kaiju vibes immediately
the vibes do be immaculate here having some great conversations
I cant wait to see what happens in here within the next following weeks we going to the moon then next galaxy
its from animathereum
i like your space ape bro what price did you buy in at?
im hyped ngl. love dragons
it just started like two days ago and its at near 4k members. theyre minting 3k
does anyone know what country the team is from?
eth is not slowing down anytime soon!
Hahaha I tip my hat to you sir from one legend to another
and theyre like im cuter than yours
Have admins given any hints about utility?  What are some cool speculations you guys have
good luck to all of you my friend 
damn weres already almost 5k members in here
oh you are whitelisted congratss you deserve it
gas prices are so wild rn its mental itll probably be like this for another few days as well
Etheruems doing crazy hopefully gas doesnt go too high when i try get my hands on this project. Shouldnt be bad if im WL. This is probs the best project going rn
yes sir my dumbass cashed one eth out yesterday for bills and now it rips kek
Eth is fr going crazy tho jesus man
Man youre also still here? Im glad to see Im not the only one going all in
Lets hope they go some breeding just like the Kaijus
Awesome!! Just babysitting and chilling with the wyverns fam. Quick question howd you WL? Interacting and being active in the community? Thanks.
Shiba doing really well when I saw it yesterday
haha yessirski got another 2 or 3 hours in me
gas will be high until the alts drop
327 gwei jesus christ vitalik pls stop
yes it is thanks to shiba and dodge
yeah its doing good thats the reason for the high gas i guess
Ye lol its increasing so quickly
I think well see some stuff above and beyond breeding  kaijus concept is really cool with DNA and stuff.  I wanna see wyverns FIGHT horde treasure etc
yep blame shiba for that one lol
Why does shiba affect gas prices?
part of me wants to go play some dota
definitely roadmap is a direct image from their game which is in alpha at the moment
ikr they had it at 200 gwei the whole day
Everything is so high right now which is insane
Exactly first round gonna be the top 200 actives ! But they gonna double check everyone
can anyone even concentrate on movie or yt when discording? xD
how we doin over here boys? Cave 2 better than Cave 1  ?
no doge is its own blockchain. Its a fork of luckycoin which uses the same underlying blockchain technology as litecoin
layered in or something. No idea
Does it cost money to list on opensea
Im trying but I couldnt so I just threw on masterchef in the background
of course it is  cave 3 will be my throne though
ahahhahaha furgang stays together yurr
lol id rather focus on this for the time being!!
fineeee  rank 53 still gotta keep going
true cant just straight up follow Kaijus
the first interaction with OS yeah youll pay a fee then you can list within that collection
yeah I see the gamification sneak peek which is why I mentioned fighting and hording treasure.  I really hope itll be a combination of firstthird person explorable open world etc
Im doing pretty good was in the 70s but I just took a break so could have fallen off. Hbu?
i really think so  anyone that wants to should be able to
nice man you have greeen congrats!!
Fee for each collection?so i can list multiple and pay for 1?
Hello Natasha im doing great. any other projects that you are looking at?
would be amazing the team has proven a lot in a short amount of time am excited for the future of this project fosho
RAge cave just turned into chil cave thats too jokes
Damn bro Im impressed at how fast you climbed the ladder
nice im closing in on top ranks myself
correct if theyre all within the same collection. lets say you had 3 zombies you list the first pay the first fee sign the thing then the other two you can just sign without paying that fee. if you decide to sell another collection say toads youll have to repeat the process
me either bro and i try so hard!
Yeah I understand the current goal is to deploy the contracts and the game aspect is still tentative.  Im just hoping to see some video demos maybe not before launch so I can scoop some before it gets too poppin! haha
baby steps man we all gonna make it
YO GUYS lets go raid cave one we gotta all go just say cave 2 raid  lets do it as soon as you see this i know ur cave 1 slow mode is off cooldown just GO
Awesome!! Looking forward to be a part of the WL group soon. Love the interaction and quality conversation in here. Especially making new friends. Thanks bud!!
top 200 is almost all 9 or above omg
is this that more popping than cave 1
they did say they plan to underpromise and overdeliver so I feel they wouldnt tell us till closer diamond hands and find out 
guys this needs all of us for it to work GO RAID CAVE 1
LMAO no point our message would get buried so quick
egg tart slow and steady is gon win the race
Souhate  you got it just keep at it  engage vibe help the community in any way possible
id rather have this than expectations that arent met
Hahaha we are focused on what we do dont worry
are russians the nicest kind of ppl?
Can i wake uo tmr to gas 38gwei 
yea currently top is level 8 and 80 to level 9
297 lol still got some ways to go lol
Anyone hitting the gym soon though!
lol dont put too much stress on this itll strain your mental
i went anyway wagmi its 1111 i alr know what i want xD
i dont wanna chat and drive but if i dont ima lose a wyvern bro
are you looking for ntfs to buy or mint?
yea but holding it is going to be the hardest part. These wyverns aint going to be playing around.
We all are! Keep going wyverns!!
Need to claim my polar beer but dont wana pay 400 for that
only just started grinding..hope i am not too late
I delayed my session quite a bit. About to go right now
Install our Discord bot to set up leveling moderation music Twitch YouTube and Reddit notifications for your Discord server.
Right! I was just going to say that. Rank bot broke haha
That things super unreliable today I tell yah. Cant find good help these days
get a bunch of ppl who know what their doing and this will take off!
i just wanna see the other variations!
Same boutta go but not for too long cuz i gotta make it back here for the lads
not stressing at all  just happy to be here and vibe with the community
tino haha howd that work out did anyone take notice
midorima89 you got it in the bag dw too much about it
Faudi  how were you able to even cop the sketches it was tough to even buy those sold out so qucik
im sorry if youre top 200 but im coming for you
i think they have people for sure who know what they are doing
ahh i see do you mean the fluffy polar bears?
A small price to pay for salvation
maybe for top 200 yes but i beleive there will be more opportunities
probably good to pin this yeah? Kishu
Thats all matter in here !  good luck again 
UwU Gangggg Imma represent by getting that whitelist
you can find it by typing !levels in botcommands too if ever forgotten
Thanks brother appreciate the support
risky boy right here  i wish i was on Hope.gg level and god tiered always
Yup would be great as many people ask for this regularly
See yall folks at the gym Ill be on mobile 
I work full time and coming in this evening and seeing how far I am from top 200 is really disheartening.  Since mee6 only counts one message per minute it would take me at least 4 hours of continuous grinding to get top 200.
Instead Ill just chill and join the convo whenever I see something interesting  I guess Ill be going secondary
Gym time. Doing pushups right now for the boys
Trying to pass 5 but hes active 
Check out my fanart what traits should I add for my Dracula ?
exactly if youre here this early than you prob have a good idea
definite i think theyre slowly pushing em out so the community doesnt go crazy haha
Faudi yeah its the first project i seen sell out at an insane rate kinda makes sense since the max per tx was 20 lol 
tino dw wel be back there and theyll finally take notice lol
Im working man not sleeping tonight lol
exactly got a good chance as well
Use  invites it should work fine 
ill do whatever it takes i want like 4 wyverns lol not just 1.
Dont worry the team already stated that you dont necessarily have to be Top 200 its understandable people have work to do and cannot be as active so they are randomly rewarding people who show honest engagement. There is always hope so try your best 
Youll get there one day keep up
Hell yeah imma head to the gym now
Nice going to check that link now
Yes....Thats not even a question. 
I also work full time theyll be plenty of other opportunities for you to get a chance at WL
Word Ima head to work be back in a couple hours
Fosho. Cant leave the fellow wyverns alone here.
and thats why this project is soo good
would you rather.. a burrito RIGHT NOW or a slot in the top 100?
I think some vampire fangs would really pull it all together!
dont stress yourself out for not getting to top 200. Its not just about the rank. Just be active and contribute to the community that works
Ok since mod is online lets make a giveaway
Give me a slot anyday and ill fast for a month
burrito! Nah def top 100 lets gooo 
why not both? get on ur phone bro! KEK
Haha yeah will do ! How about the background ? Should I change it ?
Shroomvision Going Galt Hope youre doing well my friend.
i think im also on 6 or 7 uwugmi
just have some faith guys we all good
you meet the level 200 guy yet? kek
a burrito rn top 100 will always be there haha im so hungry rn tbh even then top 200 is all u need lol 
hal nope no work today thank god hows work for you so far
bro its been 1 day and the discord has 4.6k organic members man thats nuts
Top 100 ez grinds getting 1000 messages in by tonight! LFG
always bro  you get my message?
Ive been talking sus Im level 200 now
500 wl spots giveaway at 5k members pls
I like the night background but maybe a castle in the background? Dracula lived in a castle right? With like a pointy tower? Idk thats what Im picturing 
Gus I wont stop baby we got mobile!
but then you get past with others doing the same  gl!
one of us has to make it in order to represent the uwu gang
nice man what are you training todat?
lol no ways theyll give that many away in one go
yup another reason im heavily invested in this project when a community blows up like this to 4k members with organic growth its usually a good sign for good things to come
Faudi  haha dont be so kind now thatll be too easy
im about to play runescape and chill all evening here DiCaprioLaugh matthew
I think there are already that much in the air theyre just handpicking them!
Looks like were gonna need a third cave soon Kek
Hahaha Ive been on mobile all day to grind on the go
I feel it. Just putting time in when I can
Niceee get that pump dude one of the best days
100rainbow Guys and girls just remember to make sure to get up and stretch eat and hydrate and give your dog a kiss. I realized I have been not working when I should be and not eating and drinking for the last few hours. So lets help each other stay human. heartlove

Everyone out here vibing. Love to see it
Lets keep the vibes rolling along people
Waking up to a green name would be a christmas miracle
i think we should be gucci cave 2 doesnt move so fast and its easy to have actual convos in here  maybe a cave 3 once we over 10k members soon 
Hope.gg yup theyre actively handpicking those who are active and engaging with the community.
tino one project im currently in rn is furballs community very similar to this one and its based on organic growth over 20k members rn and the roadmap and whitepaper is insane
Thanks for the reminder man! Its true we got to still be active

I like how this guy types big msgs to reply to multiple people
cave 2 is   lol  chat and people here are actually vibin and stuff
yeep we are in it for the long run now 
yes bro by close i mean like HELLA close only 24 spots away from top 200 which is 36 messages you otw man
Theres like a group of kaijus that follow eachother and it looks like a bunch are here
those hours will prove worth it no doubt in my mind
You got a lot of time on your hands  I wish man in here anytime Im not busy with something. But congrats keep grinding hard!
no i mean beforehand like what projects have you invested in that did well you have a nice ape pfp did you get one?

TylerTakesATrip  we definitely are all early looking forward to seeing all your names in green with me and enjoying the journey to get there!
Always only love for the wyverns

im in great mood but ive become hungry
Ayy fr bro. I see you out here Pain
With a name like scumbag whats not to love?
same here im also hungry lol we need a food channel asap whats ur favorite dishes mines gotta be sushi of all time i love sushi one of the best foods u can eat
i have such a busy weekend idk if i can aprticipate and be active 
my art is trash but i tried lolol
Its the thought that counts Mr Scumbag
sushi is the booooooomb dawg but i gotta say crispy chicken takes the cake for me
Bro its sick dont say that hahaha
you like dried chicken or saucy
Sushi is sick. My city has a lot of shawarma places that are dank and as Im in Canada they do chicken shawarma poutine with a bit of spicy garlic sauce added. It is the best food for after a night out hands down.
pizza is my second favorite lasagna and pizza almost interchangeable for me
it is but its not mine kekexplode
yea its way better than anything i can make 
cave 2 seems more chill than cave 1
saucy bro! full send  dry aint bad tho but chilli sauce is ALPHA
much easier to have conversations with others
best food to have at any time of the day lol except breakfast
Taut  any special type of lasagna  i also love lasagna one of my favorites
Hope.gg you already know Sashimi all the way lol i introducted my girl to that and she loved it
egg tart oh man theres so many i cant even remeember tho they differ from so many restaurants
anything with chese basically lol
thats what im talking about brother  one more  boneless vs with bones
Cave 2 is my home. Welcome to the dark side cave 1 people
blockhead is my signature character on my OS
welcome to the dark side beeplezilla 
ketchup with rice ONLY? PepeSHOOT
cave 2 a bit slower but we good
woah dont tell me you eat boneless!!!! no way you do
Idiled  same here rice is great with everything LOL 
KietHoang  it sure is cave 2 you can actually have conversation with others
I like my moms homemade havent had anything else. Just ground beef mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce 
haha i had this same problem...came back to my computer..cant leave the community

yes i love cheese sadly i have become slightly lactose 
If anyone wants any help lemme know
I love wings whats your go to place?

becoming lactose intolerant is my biggest fear lol
Cave 2 huh? Is this where all the WL are pogtasty
i would unfriend you if i were them ngl lol
i grind for over 4 hours and lvl8. What about you?
buffalo wild wings but hitting a lot of wingstop lately kek theres better places sure
The soon to be Whitelisters yes 
damn thats difficult...being allergic to the food you love is depressing
ima have to stop somewhere nice now cause thats too good sounding
I am bothered by the people who choose to dip their wings in ranch instead of Bleu cheese
Cave 2 best cave prove me wrong.
nothing much to do today just uni work
everyone is lactose intolerant its just how much can you take. 2 cups of milk in 1 day is way past my limit now sadly.
oof hard one gotta say this Chinese place down my road is crazy with it
dont stop! enjoy what the community has to offer
I be going to wing stop too but yea id agree there are way better places out there. Wing stop is the most convenient for me
have you tried cheese with it tho like the korean style
Not grinding vibing and having fun 
Imagine being weak to cow juice
so what time is it for yall any west coasters?
same here im lactose and it sucks ass ill be eating all these dairy related food and my stomach would be kickin
Shisyuo hey it was a one time mistake haha i was so hurt when they brought us the wings and it looked boneless 
kennayyy  yup facts cave 2 the best cave cave 1 the best cave dont even sound right LOL
Sweet Im in the right place then
how does that translate to how much cheese u can eat in a day?
yeah same. i really been craving like bbq brisket though Drool
not ever bro to the TOP  if yall dunno what mes mes is. youre wrong
Thanks. Hope I can make it for WL
haha a bit confused. I worked hard to get to level 9 already. trying to get into the top 100
understandable tbh chill day it sounds like
i choose the spicy hot chili sauce over everything
Shisyuo  i cant choose any cheese im lactose intolerant  i used to have it alot but makes me sick
wassup henry no1 or are you no2???
Good mate nice too see you are still here haha
ooooo some guy recommended me a chinese wing place called san tung a bit ago. Might go check it out one day
Wings with ranch is so good tho.
v1 i like where your mind is at. Did we just create a connection 
Welcome youll have a great time
Hahah im glad you love my jokes 
PUPepeSith  order fool! I know u crave it too
yea i just fight it haha. Not giving dairy up thats for sure.
RISE UP my wyv buddies! We have some plundering to do. So much gold to steal!
I love dad jokes thats my sense of humour so they dont go unappreciated
Thanks. We gonna grind for this. Art is sick. Stonk
i order to much food i should pickup today
Shisyuo yea mean it is what it is tho
crazy i turned this into food channel after mentioning sushi LOL
kennayyy  we just mightve haha community is going great so far
Taut  yup just learn to deal with it cause cmon food be too good to pass up like you cant pass up a good ass meak just cause youre lactose till your sitting on the toilet full of regrets LOL
Hello beautiful girl. I saw you on the VN chat channel I greeted you there.
Wings with ranch are good for sure. But wings with chunky Bleu cheese are so much better. If ranch is the only option then sign me up but if I have the choice then you know Im going for those chunks
Hows everything going there my friend?
so the difference is the transportation? or u planning to get smth else today? KekW
Going great! I love your doodle 
do a quick google search everyone is lactose intolerant it all depends on how much lactase you have that can digest the amount of Lactose you take it
sheeeeeeeesh you a beast lol and Hope.gg i think i gotta chinese place on the way for sure im in atlantacatjam catjam ima run in the first
guys ive been grinding for almost 12 hours now this songs keeping me going xD 
I didnt like cheese before this year. I will have to try bleu cheese now because of you
driving to the gym rn what yall up to
guys no one is safe here. The grind never stops
Ooo? Hello sorry didnt notice your chat X hows everything going on there?
yeah it is just keep having great conversations and also go for all the giveaways lets get it
i didnt know that always assumed it was a medical condition and not general to every1
i love bleu cheese at wingstop it enhances the flavor so much lol 
TylerTakesATrip no grind only vibin with the chat 
Yea haha but even in the worse of it never once did i think Im going to give up dairy 
good  just chillin around how bout yourself?
for real man...yall got the role but still engaged in the community its good to see
Shisyuo thank you sir gotta do whatchu gotta do from rank 270 to top 40
Vaansh  Playlist  283 songs  5 likes
you can talk there if you want a better grind. there is no slowmode
No youre the beast with that sick pfp man
Stonk 100 .. 1 BREATHE  1 BREATHE
i intend on staying here a long time cooldance
idk how this man doesnt like cheese. cheese is such a diverse flavor profile. Yeah but you still want that whitelist lol
you got shake shack around you?
hey man im trying to get some convo going here kekexplode
Do you just get regular hot wings? Dry or saucy?
you learned something new  Lots of people tend to become more lactose intolerant as they grow up as their enzymes dies.  It really sucks. Sadly Lactase enzymes are not recoverable.
Im right behind hahaha dont slow down
Ooo yeah sure Im good with any channels everyone will get WL 3
the real diamond hands right here lol
hve you ever had dry rub lemon pepper wings
it wont matter tho xp goes by the minutes keeps it fair for everybody 
!CosmicWyverns Rummy159  you already know the answer to this sushi lol 
TylerTakesATrip trust me everybody will get whitelist eventually with 3400 spots to go around everybody is gon get one i believe it 
need that dedication. Sadly have to leave my laptop to go eat later. Maybe ill bring it to continue the process LOL
I bounce around. I like them all but I do usually go with something spicy
It is 4 am in Vietnam and everyone is sleeping. Can you go over there to talk?
We need new wyvern emotes in the server or im out 
I think they also randomize it never know which chat gives how much xp and it can change.
wait 3400? Im so focused on those 200
i ate wings with a knife and fork as much as i could then finished them off with one hand while typing with the other if i can you can too xD
corm44  asian zing from bww is my favorite
is there anything people can do to prevent it?
congratz you got this in no time
asian zing is super fire  love BWW
i dont think so its just adaptations as we get older
Who will dance once they get WL?
but im going to a restaurant tho. But I might just do it. For the FUTURE
I dont think thats unfair. Everything created by mods has a reason for it. and I chat with people not just spam
I am doing fine too what are you doing?
aww thats unfortunate. Shakeshack is a must have its sooo good 
just keep having lactose but wear diapers everywhere you go 
Dry lemon pepper is the only dry rub ill go for. You should try it
pain mango habanero is good too. Have you ever tried that before?
get takeaway for the future! elmorage
i swear its only good every once in awhile if u have it to often its mid af
Yep passing 5 and then relax for a bit
check my message history....i said im doing a dance if i get WL for sure lol
youre always one step ahead thanks hyx
Umm not quiet sure being healthy and eating well is always something that can prevent things like that. you can take pills that help fight lactose when you intend to eat it. But to do something specific you would have to look into it yourself. Im not that knowledgeable about it.
FarhanZ bout to do some muscle ups at the gym. know anything bout that?
lmao yup thats the mindset reach higher top 200 seems very likely as long as you stay engaged with the community
ErniETH  awh if so i didnt know it works like that
kennayyy  dry lemon pepper dry garlic parm mango harb omg all top tier flavors and i havent had wings in so long
Excellent choice my fellow Canadian
this right here health is wealth
make sure to shuffle the songs arent sorted
There are quite a few Vietnamese people there. chat channel seems pretty boring
Im still grinding hahaha for real not stopping until im in the WL
Shisyuo dont even know what that is im from south africa homie xD
awww do you speak eng fluently too?
Muscle ups are hard i can only do regular pull ups
idk man its just my go to place maybe my taste buds just suck kekw
I just put away an entire sleeve of Oreos I need help lmao
Okay Im down with fanart for now
yea muscle ups are a great exercise if done properly but I think there are better exercises for target those muscle groups
for sure health is number 1. well number 2 after wyverns p
This shit is going so fast on my phone o.o
you need to be super strong to do muscle ups man
all you can eat buffet. You dont have it there?
yes main focus is wyverns atm lol
no sir my english is pretty bad
did you eat them with milk lol oreos be bangin tho tbh i havent had those in years
Shannon336  might just end up getting wings since ebveryone was talking bout it lol
I see  yeah most ppl are here in this English Channel3
oh man i would do the same.. no self control
I learnt english by chatting here
your english is perfect man keep chatting away
I saw that in the initial announcement!
Hyxder  Ottawa here checking in! Lots of Canadians in the NFT space it seems! And Indonesians also it feels like
oh i just didnt recognize the acronym we do its just not alot of high quality ones there are good ones but they mad pricey
im not very strong but i can when i need to be for the people i need to be for!
Where are you from and what language is native there
My god this is by far the best fan art I have seen yet check out RemGees animated Wyvern!

I never had dry garlic parm before. Hmm maybe ill give it a shot the next time i go. Dam Now I want wings LOL
alright good to here ill just stick to this channel for now as intereacting in here is pretty easy
kennayyy  what you never had garlic parm and you love wings ok question wingstop or buffalo wild wings
that applies here as well. Its kinda like a once in a while thing with AYCE. I sometimes eat till I throw up to make my moneys worth lol
insane for someone who just joined MatthewSmoke must really love the wyverns
everyone go react rn! this man deserves some attention
yeah talking to people makes me feel good. how are you today?
like when my kid loses their fav blanket lol
Its all good what language do you normally speak
fuuuuugggg broooooo. Wings are so good but theyve gone up so much in price
How do we tell whether we rank in top 200?
you lost the ball!!!! you was too busy reading chat and forgot that you even took your dog out  
TylerTakesATrip fr everything got so much more expensive cause of covid such a shame
Yeah was her fav one and I was concentrating on discord so idk where she lost it 
getting a tesla after i cop this lol
I thought you were talking about a dry garlic parm. I had these best garlic parm wings at a bar one time. The best garlic parm I have ever had.
I never had wingstop before so bww is key

Gus look at you  forgetting what you said sounds like you need some rest

How do we check if we In the top 200
Ikr i hate how the wings costs so much these days.

Install our Discord bot to set up leveling moderation music Twitch YouTube and Reddit notifications for your Discord server.
Go to botcommands and type !rank
Go to bot command channel and put !rank
Hahaha I could say the same to you pal we are in the same boat
lmaooo i was just thinking about that cant go wrong with mc chickens
fluxray its awesome nft could be huge for virtual tino ye fb is iew but what they wanna make is good m.A.A.d men virtual with only a glasses and 3d social   house
i know i aint going nowhere either lol
Nothing wrong with some McDs now and again
hey facebook is still popular for like business purposes lol 
Nemerz to chceck simply head on over to botcommands  and type in !rank 
kennayyy any of your favorite wing flavors cause theyre all better than bww 
Gus  lets call it quits and head out together 
take a rest man! ill come welcome u again later!
I know Im going to get through this we are all good
yeah but im permaskinny i got cheat codes
Put notification to only mentions
fair enough  might have to give it a revist after years lol
i fw buffalo but thats just me. Lemon pepper is good too. pls lmk how much the wings cost now
v1 yeah cause the supply chain is all messed up
A small price to pay for a wyvern
yea man im rank 248....aint giving up lol
Fb is not my thing but they have a company name called Meta so fb is a side hussle
yeah its gotten better but like no where near where it should be at
Shisyuo  hell yeah for work purposes tho only lol
TylerTakesATrip  noooo whats wrong with wingstop 
Hahaha oh right i feel that im not to that point yet itll get there

well my metabolism is that of a 15 year old still so im unaffected  however im in my late 20s
yup best way to go thru it ive been doing it and it doesnt feel like a grind but more like just chatting with the community and havin fun 
corm44  sorry LOL it was just what one of the mods said haha
Gus ok yeah the community here is kinda crazy and people seem to be climbing ranks quick ahaha
for those of you in college what are you studying and why??
Just saw Cave 2.. So whats the scene with 2 caves 
yea need liek top 150 to bee safe haha
I was like Im only at like 340! I need more time! 
Yea unfortunately hahah but we keep going
Its been a while since the last one
Im studying architectural technology and its because I worked as a contractor for years and thought it was relevant to my life experience 
cave 2 is where the true wyverns chill
Top 100 not tooooo hard just talk to us hahaha
Yea its going to be tough hitting 200 isnt safe on its own
wow the vibe in here is amazing
Hhh beta but what they do is making nft more famous
rain falls down they crash around mecatjam
going to get harder and harder the next few hrs for new people tbh
your pfp is the robot one right?
oh wow thats a really cool major
thats great ErniETH hows it all working out for you sounds interesting and fun
Not. I had a bit of a misunderstanding because I thought it was closed. haha. if I wanted that would it make someone sad. v
lmao i doubt theyll do it this soon because they barely just announced it dw your in good hands still 
Wei  ugh i didnt mean to scare the chat LOL i just wanted to give a heads up
luew you have to look in giveaways frequently
Yes its been tough with work today not gonna lie
wonder how many in the top 200 rn already have WL  are mods or admin
Everybody from top 200 should sleep BC im going all night bois
yea you go to bed wake up and be like top 400
Honestly though I think you should just focus on having conversations instead of the number because the number is important but Its not everything g heartlove
its been here for a while cave 1 got too caotic 
just wait a bit and ill be happy  im almost there!
Dont grind too hard you guys need sleep 
no ones sleeping in this channel
i hope i dont wake up and become 400th lmao but ima go till i cant today
this looks an  awful lot like kaiju
conversations are everything dont worry about hte number ever 
idk i though it was a frost one tbh xD
Thats why Im saying youre never safe here
i see.. i vibe with better cave.. Lets go
Yeah it could really be the top 300 get it depending on when they do the snapshot and how many already have whitelist
hey i just got back what do you mean   people keep thinking ive been here forever Gus  back me up on this 
Taut  LMAO take a break for a whole day and your not even top 200 no more its scary for sure but if you keep at it at the rate your going youll be more than safe
keep it up buddy. you are doing great
awful lot better than a kaiju  a wyv is a completely dif thing from a kaiju if you know your lore
i hear what your saying for sure man...but im just being honest...i really like this proejct...i cant afford gas wars...im here to be apart of this community too man but whitelist only way i can afford one
Just gotta keep the vibes going
yeah lil slower and a lil more pizazzzz
understandable. gets me super excited
mcdonalds skipped me in the 2 person line how annoying
just dont like his tactics and he creeps me tf out
Hahaha I mean you werent away for long enough for us to think you went to sleep
Thanks! Second year now so its getting pretty intense haha doing alright though. 
fluxray  thank you! Its mostly AutoCAD Revit and learning the building code lol
v1 KietHoang Thanks for support Im still going strong.
he does look creepy but at least he is pushing the metaverse forward pumping our bags
nice!! im a software engineering student so i feel you
Yess very my whole life is based off vibes so thats my motto
lol i know man...i wish i didnt have work tomorrow morning man lol
I think everyone understands that man. we should think that high rank is proof of their hard work.
Be an active member giveaways  channel has a lot of chances for you to offer. Stay tuned
have you been enjoying studying it so far?
yup exactly some people are already whitelisted in the top 200 so it can be like top 250 instead
Dope! heartlove but if you just have conversations the numbers will just flow my friend.
Oh yeah thats intense! Hows it going for you?
true but not ready for it to go into super corpo hands tbh...
hey same goes here. Im about to call in loool. jkjk
i hate school so not particularly but its been a good experience since ive had a few internships
agreed lol...thats why i always try t o reply to someone in every message to increase engagement
does software engineer do like coding and stuff?
its hard to converse with one minute slowmode but i try
aww i feel you im a self taught software engineer too cuz i hate school
mcdonalds is whack lmao  ima eat it tho
dont let the numbers scare you keep interacting with the chat and youll be top 200 trust me just chat away and let things happen
Taut  keep at it haha theyre trailing onto you
The internships probably teach you more about the job than school does eh? Thats what Ive heard from people who finished my program and did placements
i swear you told me you level 13 haha
yeah agreed just have a few many convos 
haha its okay i like it  once in a while is fine
guys from other timezones were sleeping hehe
Im trying to find a job and its been really difficult 
hahahah calling in sick might not be a bad idea hahah
agreed so is what facebook building is that more facebook own and less decentralized right
Nice to see you here! Welcome to the best cave 
0x whats your favorite thing to get at mickyDs
You can grind out lvl 9 in like 5 hours people just gotta be committed
definitely thats what ive done today
welcome back my troll friend . Taut  no way i said that. just started.
Yup thats what Im hoping if they stop it before I get into 200
Im not scum bag but Im a big fan of getting a junior chicken and a McDouble and creating one sandwich with both
Wishing you all the best on the hunt.. I migh rejoin next year.. badly wanted a year break to figure things out
what do you work on? hal for the last couple of months i am ye
usually ends up that way doesnt it? also lets huge business get in. I like its grassroots rn
yeah people do gotta be commited but 5 hrs is a long time for sure i think other ways are just being active and helping the community and those are handpicked by the team corm44   sub 200s
wow that is self taugh engineer is impressive
word thats awesome. been looking to get into it but i have no time
I always get the mcchicken. Where are you from? I never heard anyone say Junior chicken before. I really like the sausage egg sandwich
must have been someone else i was talking to who had the same image haha. Getting you guys mixed up.
constant interaction starting to slow down a bit but the community is keeping me awake
bruhh he is talkin to the user 0x  xD not you
But we rotate places so we never sleep
i am an app developer... so mostly those... been working 6 years.. and NFTs wasnt letting me have time... so took a yaerbrea k
true it is sad to see it go that way but i feel we will have a big push from the decentralized community here
I got a double quarter pounder with sweet tea large fries and 2 cookies
totally agree wyvern life is lambo life
yea man we need that green baby lolll
Yes. This is a quality community
mc chicken and double cheeseburger are top tier can never go wrong with those but fries be a hit or miss lol sometimes they be heavenly or straight up garbo
0x  ooooo great meal enjoy it  lmk how u feel after lol
slowing down a bit gives us a chance to grab a huge lead 
Canada. Its like a small mcchicken off the value menu.
yeah i agree. I just think anything fb does especially in a big way like this always turns out bad for the lil guy
top 200 is probably going to be a race tho xD
yeah we will get our real wyvs so we will be different soon 
KietHoang  sure is and a very busy one
youre right thats probably the best thing ive heard all day
i have 50k points earned this year alone i eat it for lunch daily. i weigh 160 lol
agreed they arent necessarily the most optimal company to do it but at least its a start everyone trying to jump into the space because we are moving so fast
Yeah being friendly and funny will go a long way sometimes. Ive been whitelisted at a few servers for just that
relax you have plenty of time my guy!
it already is xD i got here a lil late but got loads of sleep last night
I know! I literally opened saying I wasnt the person he asked lol I just wanted to share my meal of choice
thats what i like to hear. cosmicwyvern
i guess that suits better yh depending on how fast they are going to snapshot
JEEZ. I eat chickfila a lot as well. Good stuff. Gods chicken
yes it did you posted a fake nitro pic that was obvious.
hal chick fila isnt a dollar tho
ErniETH im pretty close to canada. Im in buffalo right now. Yeah the junior chicken is called the mc chicken for us in the states
yeah. Take time to chill. theres always room for the deserving
Yea.. gotta always keep in 200 and you are good to go ..
Wdym fake i paid 10 bucks for it
yup take things slow and steady and youll win the race lol
oh my god ur massive! in a good way
chickfila is insanely expensive man im right with u
Hahaha thanks for including me Struge didnt like me including myself. Well I learned something new about Canadian McDs today lol
already scary though lvl 9 is top 200 so cant imagine what it will be in a few days xD
I think Ive heard that somewhere before
Lmfaoo you been here you know shes been doing it for a minute now
100rainbow who else here has a full time job? wlcclfg
Preach more... When the gas fee are low we hussle in the discord and keep our whitelists in place   Wei  Gotta do it everyday in that case
wow im already 66. Top 50 here i come 
whenever you get the chance try it. very worth it.
yeah its very expensive to eat but it be sooooo gooood can never go wrong with chic fil a 
corm44   you probably have lol its a common saying 
Rikimaaro  man gas been so high tho as of lately god damn shiba lol
oof. My canadian friends came down last year and had it for the first time. It truly is gods chicken
haha. i have never seen dab. but really want to try it once
Ooooh right on my tail! Im sitting at 60
oooo why is there a second cave
yeah im gonna have to try it for sure ill prob be in florida some time this winter so maybe if they have it there ill give it a try D
Try inviting more of your friends in here but make sure not to spam random people
Wyverns need more than one cave to nest in.
ErniETH we all inclusive here man. I got you anytime 
with all the hacks going around...i dont think its funny posting fake links and stuff
ayeee where in FL? i live down here and work  a cfa lol
Yea.. these shit coins eating ETH network.... Or was it an inside job from SOL big brains .. Lol
so we can split the caht  so many people
ouch mine as well.. wyvs are painful!
I got 1 friend in here that Ik is crazy about nfts I never just spam random friends on discord that Ik wont actually benefit the project
Ill happily share my rank with you Shroom!
this is the place for people who want to chill man. There seems to be more hustle on the other side
im in both caves so hard to keep up though haha
grinding is pain  .. I just get into usful convos... a WW ..   isnt it 
im bout to full as heck i got so much food
yes this is the way to do it  so much to gain from it as well as there are so many in dif cultures here
im so ready for this damn project already xD WEN AMA

I want to be able to write in all uppercase so I can say lfgggg
Whos ready to push me to the top 3
prob orlando or something thats where most people from canada end up when they go to FL lmao
I cant read the chat in time when Im in cave 1
I didnt want to say anything lmao. Im glad we can all agree shes trying to pump fake us every 10 minutes haha. I think shes posting a picture.
hal my favorite is popeyes. Their chicken is much crispier and flavorful than cfa
Hahahaha the guys wouldve loved that
Lmao you are actually grinding so hard what time is it for you
i didnt have a convo to jump into but now i do  hows it going
to each their own. i like the grilled sandwiches at cfa better than the fried ones anyways so
Cant agree more.. Just love all the degens in the space... These times we are living in are someting of a lifetime....
1am but top 2 is easy just 1k exp
impossible so i stay in cave 2 lol
me to! i have so many questions for the team
damn bro youre about to start a chicken war in this channel lmao
I wonder when we will be able to use gifs  I need my gifs! KEKW but I do have kekw so I am fine with that as well
the moon will never come to you because you are like the sun. so brilliant
lmao fr maybe it was the big sol brains haha 
0x oh no the worst feeling gotta be if they take the snap shot and your rank is 201 LOL
how about we start a battle between cave 2 and cave 1 haha
stay up kings. we all in this together
You going to sleep anytime soon ? 
I never had their grilled sandwiches. Maybe ill look into that the next time i go. Is it amazing?
gifs are the way! i also need gifs!
Going smooth ... Just sitting next to a bed calling me to sleep but ignoring it and chilling out with u guys... hows it there ?  v1  when did u get into NFTs ... would love to hear your ape story 
Strugelabs Im sure when things settle down. They will have one
what kind of battle do you want?
Grilled chicken sandwiches from cfa are great
what else would you recommend cfa? i never had it before
oh i am staying up  all nighter for me. vegasm  im sure just ready for one asap!
its good im getting hungry but will snack on something soon. making a ton of friends here its awesome 
Idk Ive never heard of that server before 
just take a nap anyways lol rest is always important remember you can always come back stronger after you feel rested up and chat for even longer

Cavesters.. i just got in top 200.. was at 450... Lets goooo 
Bro were all tired lets go to sleep at the same time
People cant wait I think. Have the urge to spam. Lol
She wants to catch up to him and take over being rank 1
Well maybe if i will be number 1 mods wilp finally notice me
im a basic kind of person lol its gotta be roasted oolong tea but if im feeling fruity ill go for a peach sweet tea drink its so good you have to try it
i saw!!! cg dude but keep goin. cant hurt to help the community
the bot can take a seat PUPepeMadLeaveFinger
you are awesome as well! good luck 
Someones mad coz was too slow to grab a nitro 
fok it everyone get bubble tea rn
It does sound delicious right about now right?
Exactly thats why I like this 1 minute timer
Yea.. i am a community oriented soul.. Lets add value wherever we go 
i see you i always prefer the sweet fruity drinks too i also go for like green tea or jasmin tea
Oo pepper jack cheese sounds soo good right about now. Im too busy talking here. I should get some food soon haha
midorima89 we should be good. Shes not ruining our vibes here in cave 2 LFG!
fluxray you dont have cfa near you?
so wait is this on sol or eth blockchain? i dont even know yet
yeah lemme just unplug em real quick! PUPepePunch
i dun need your fake nitro!  when you wake up ill be above you
ive never had bubble tea either 0
give em a good ol 30 second reboot!
you have an orc!?!?!? lucky mothaaaaaaa. I wanted one so bad...
cave 2 the best cave haha  cave 1 cant even compare to us 
AirWolf oh man i had a green tea faze for awhile like i was getting green tea everything for a min lol  i love green tea
Where ya from that there no bubble tea?
you gotta try it at least once in your life
find pretty god convo in chat 2 for sure
i love me a orange yakult from bubble tea shops
green tea is just so good and feels so comforting
ive never had bubble tea. it seems too too sweet
yeah i have two  one lv 36 w 22 zug bonus one lv 20ish just farmign zug for raids. the floor is a lot more affordable now compared to project launch
i like thai tea better personally
even everywhere in america has it!
yayy you giving us all bubble tea 
They dont have to be sweet! Theres all kinds. I like the brown sugar milk teas though and they are very sweet
but it seems there are a lot of people selected for the wl there
Hyxder the tea with the balls in it
Tell it to 2 litres of coffee i have drank 
i always get 0 sugar LOL cus the tapioca is already soaked with soakedcooked with sugar so thats enough for me. 
Wanted goblins to be just like them but they fumbled the minting and its probably not gonna moon anymore 
I think it depends on which flavour you choose
whats the alternative to pearls? ive heard people say this before just dont know what it is
thats true! so many calories in those
they could end this in a week  watch your back
milk tea sounds interesting. are there ones that are like iced coffees
Ive been a boba drinker for like 20 years! Certain parts of SoCal have boba shops on every corner.
Time to start making some dinner
i got so much sleep last night that i wont need any tonight 
yeah had seen. Will jump in soon most likely
What are the daily exercise routines yall do  ? ..
Im gona be level 100 by then and the only one in top 500 without a green name
at the moment yes when more people come in we will  need a cave 3
Pearls are the best part. My word you guys have me ready to Uber eats a bubble tea. Cave 2 was probably created by the Master Wyvern himself once cave 1 got way too hectic
sounds really great. where are you from?
10000 pull ups in a triple gravity chamber
cant relate either no sleep yet
than you have to wait a loongg long time
cave 1 because 1 is always the best 
man facts they are comforting as hell lol  green tea makes me very happy 
Infintrus been the best and will always remain the best
cave 2  best cave just like 1 BREATHE  1 BREATHE
Chia seeds pudding aloe coconut jelly lychee bits.....theres a bunch. And you dont have to get milk tea. Theres fruit teas and regular green or black teas.
pretty much everywhere close to me does as well
yeah i didnt like the whole way to get WL on there.. thats a super grind lmao
Cave 2 and chill cave is where I shall stay occasional rage rage
i have the same feeling for matcha
On the topic of boba whats your favorite place to get it?
Yeah theres coffee ones! Thats the first one I tried because my gf introduced me to them and she knows Im a coffee guy at heart haha. Im no expert on bubble tea though Ive only tried a few
Im not sleeping till green boys
you sound like a bubble tea connoisseur
so anyone here doesnt drink coffee? aPESHide
Yup! Gotta have choices. Coworkers are planning a boba order tomorrow since Postmates had a bunch of discount codes rn. Where ya at?
Hey Coach! Long time no see hahaha
youre almost to 200 now bro just 3 more spots ooga

im really close too.....like 230
Matcha ice cream is where its at I love that so much
dude i swear they are the same too.. matcha green tea ice cream is insane.. we have this place in seattle that has the best match ice cream.. might have to get some tonight.
Gona feel bad passing my bro cade but it has to be done
Maybe just tell the people working what your tastes are and they should be able to recommend something youll enjoy!

Yo guys how can i have a background for my rank in bot commands

Install our Discord bot to set up leveling moderation music Twitch YouTube and Reddit notifications for your Discord server.

oh send me exp I need it to for my final push into the top! 
i hope that I will make it so you guys
Ive been at this since 5am and im barely hanging onto 197!!! thats crazy af to me tbh
get some rest lol youre man than safe dw ill be here when you wake to tell u how many ranks u gone up haha
BoNFT  same its kinda hard for me to get matcha i cream  i gotta travel like 30 mins away from where im at
your a good guy man...thank you for the enougrment much apprecaite
true need to keep it natural and somewhat healthy
Same here my friend! All I drink at home. Ill get something sweet once in a while at Starbucks though
Black coffee is very bitter. eww. I cant drink it
im also grinding for battlepass with Aawez  im diamond 2
what do you normally get? ive never had bubble tea but all my friends go crazy over it
plus it doesnt taste good to me like that
sheesh youre better than me. gotta give it to you man
dont remember the name of it but it was an actual grind lmao.
Hahaha yeah but I dont want to miss anything this community is the best for real
Whats up homies anyone know who mallaa is?
Im just 1 away from the top lol
na you learn to like it Ive been told black coffee is healthier than water
you havent had bubblle tea before? its so good you have to try it!
Oh yeah is that the one where everyone has the black and white pfp thing? KEKW
I heard someone mention it before is it good?
true same goes for me but I dont drink it all that often
Bubble tea is really good I usually go for a taro bubble tea
Drinking too much is not good my friend. Have you tried Vietnamese black coffee yet?
i need it when doing nft like i do lol
damn yall are same color kaiju as well haha
not yet I just drink any black coffee it doesnt even wake me up lmao
I think a good beginner drink is a jasmine milk green tea with boba. Or like the house milk tea with boba. If youre worried about sugar just ask for 50 sugar. Alot of places make it too sweet for me.
oooo vietnamese coffee heard many good things about it but havent tried it yet
Gus  yeah once you hit the bed you miss out on everything lol thats how it goes with nfts literally the only thing holding you back is your best friend  sleep lol 
Hyxder wow crazy to see how high people are up lol its insane how much messages there are
i seen you wtih me bro theyll notice us soon
damn what time is it where you are?

Cosmic Wyvern. Like Shroomvision Going Galt said. Are you...something different? Sus... 
haha but if you are making profits  then it is worth
The only appropriate answer tbh. Heard its the year of the wyvern 
Doing good man tryna get that coach Greg ice cream recipe 
I actually plan on visiting Vietnam in the future. I have a friend in another group that sends pics and it looks beautiful
its just regarded as a rude sign. associated with negativity
thank you sir  wyvern. Dachshundwizard  Twitch   i am the vibe brotha
yup its great to see that these wyverns are amazing and i cant wait for them to come out 
midorima89 best part is whitelisted still hanging around to chat even if theyre awarded already
AirWolf  yeah  but im not a huge fan like my girl she goes  crazy over that lol
good to see some mods in chat 2!
ahhahaah i did this for fortnite

patience is the name of the game 
Yeah lol we just have same jacket

Strugelabs  hey atleast thats when every nft look kinda cheap lol till you saw the big ole eth price

Sleep and wake up to top 100 from top 10
lmao is the grind that bad that you gotta be on at all times?

AirWolf yeah i was able to mint like 3 on mint day it was quite expensive with gas  my. average being .75 pretty good compared to others but it was still expensive
i didnt but i bought at the dip so it was a nice come up
ima make a note to visit thailand too I heard it was the same vibes
yes thats pretty normal. Everything is amazingly cheap in Vietnam
Trick or treating with the kid and watching the Braves beat the Astros 
I saw a white lady behind our house when I was a kid it happened behind our house which is a cemetery...
bojangles oh that is still your furry child
its really packed at least before covid it was
well itd be a lot of calories...
I think your safe too. so dont worry.
nah nah but im skinny still. but i dont have a problem with being skinny so no need to bulk
doing great just eating random snacks
AHHHHHHH THATS SO CREEEPY MAN!!! Hope youre not too scared
oh wow yeah that is still expensive but you sold them all im sure they went up pretty high
Come and experience the real thing. it will be better for you
who knows lmao. kennayyy  145 or something like that.
I agree with you he has to rest by now
I like when everyone tells you to eat more and then you do then its like ok what next lol
ayeee im rooting for braves as well!!! i hope they finish it at home over the weekend would be awesome to see!

James Harden but hes been shooting very poorly. Fred VanVleet is starting to get it together and I made some solid waiver moves with Horford and Bane to solidify my squad 
cave 2 is filled with actual conversations though its great
Thats awesome! have fun! Thursday night football packers vs cardinals
yes come to cave 2 the echoes that bounce off these walls and crevices are much cleaner 
yeah apparently hes still dealing with hamstring issues but hell pick it uo
Write a meal plan for me  ty my diet sucks
LA had so many hobos and I feel like the vibe of everything and even the people I talked to was so superficial  but then again I only visited the tourist spots
So when I was a kid I saw a ghost doll I was freaked the f out!
fr its just a vibe in here. no spamming
I smell a love collection  between me and 3 spot
Gotta order food but cant take a break from chat
welcome back to cave 2 the best cave cave 1 dont got nothing on us  
Zayd  it fr is once they opened up thecave2  ive been in here since LOL 
FREDDIE  yup exactly with cave 2 you can have actual convos with people where as cave 1 you just get a bunch of random spammers
yes there are a few canada meeps in here
Thats why I tried to keep convos but its hard
i think hyx only likes canadian people
Lmaooo yea a break from this could be little usefull what game is going on
yeah isnt for me like i said. Heard its worse now lmao
woot rank 141 we are getting somewhere  top 100 here i come
i cant even diet with all this nft stuff
Yo I can see that and I respect it
Fr man sitting at my computer for hours I forget to eat sometimes
lmaooo me either just eating my feelins away
my friends that lived in cali for a few years said the same thing when they came back about the superficialness
Im marginally sticking in the top this is challening.
thats amazing! i was lucky enough to get a 1 of 1 bonji recently that was the luckiest ive been
you saw Annabelle haha thats so scary
Both are good but we all know 2nd is better
Lmaooo hell yeah they dont know what theyre missing out on in cave 1

tino cali is great food vibes weather aveeyrthing bout it its just expensive tho lol 
Robert yup we found ourselves a gem for sure so lucky to be in it so early
yeah I just hit level 6 a bit ago. now it will be tough to climb ranks
facts howd you like james bond?
Im rank 42 Ive came far but I could still go beyond not giving up
bots are super easy to spot tbh.
nice man you are still early in here
Im still a bit jealous you live in Japan haha
Ngl we should do a gang vs gang vs cave 1
And we def will wincoz of me ofc
so who knows what a wyvern is lol
mine was pretty hot earlier but now its pretty cold outside but its humid lmao
twitter its not hype at all  i just like the art so far
pain no I meant the dude thats rank 2 !! You do be chilling my guy keep it up!
Level 9 soon still not in top 200
Gus yessir! i like that from you
haha im jealous you get to see so many celebs!
hows the weather for those outside of Canada?
every so often i think yesterday we only 19 and today were at 86 so that was a huge jump
Yup thats the thing with timezones Im afraid

When i joined dc u alrdy  had 10k so gl man u will need it
Ranks get little harder when its low
whats the difference in this and thecave lol
i heard bots are getting smarter i saw one the onther day the time coded to write a message is random and messages are pretty human too!!
liked a lot can tell a lotttt of work went into that one. not the best bond film of Daniels imo but not his fault regardless very happy to have gone to see it
Syd Rogers dry? I dont think Ive ever had dry hot pot. Any chains that a Californian would know about?
BadBoyKarma EZ money is the best money 
damn all i see is ur number 1 spot
The wyvern is a fictional winged reptile that appears in medieval folkloric tales.
Kururuvi go to botcommands and type in !rank
All good thanks bro ! What about you ?
fr and chillcave too its more relaxed there than thecave
yeaahh the art is so fire. im so curious to see all the different kind of wyverns they have
Hahaha it becomes nothing after your first couple. They are people just like us. A lot are actually super nice!
Cave 2 is where all the lit people chat 
Were the bigger better shinier version. Cave 2.0 we got nicer vibes in here
no doubt  the higher ranked ones will be cool to see
Ya I felt the same way nothing will beat casino royale and skyfall for me but I thought it was a good end to the criag era
It seems you joined 4 hours after I did tho pepethink
close to Canada it super cold in that area right now
soon will have cave 3 when number of members are higher
cave2 master race you know the vibes
haha yea ive heard that. i never met any celebs before
omg my grind has got to continue then
LMAOOOO gotta add that one to the books
i need to use the bathroom but i am currently trying to engage in more conversations here
fr we just vibing here and listening to each other
so like a dragon basically....just cosmic wyvern sounds wya cooler than cosmic dragon lol
there was one earlier theyre like a limited time event 
u will get green when you hit rank 1
Im doing well! Meeting a lot of new people in here and everyone seems reallly cool. Happy to be a part of building the community 
Dr.Gino3335  I heard vibing was actually the Doctors orders so I had to
Theres ranks? Seems to defeat the purpose of looking for actual people but I guess it helps when someone gets upset that they werent given WL but have half a page of interaction. lol
anyone else absolutely vibing rn
TylerTakesATrip Ayye tyler wassup man
xp given per min though but yeah i guess its harder to reply to people in 1min slowmode
Mazeltov idk imma go look it up for you
Thats just rank not leaderboard
Hyxder ill just be active in general then. No way i can get to the top 200 people that posts the most messages. Hyxder can I ask how you and the other greens already got their WL? is it being the first 500?
GL am not willing to give it up easy though dance3
Yeah but who remembers the candy crush days 
a wyvern does sound pretty cool
Is quality. Everyone on cod still falls for it
yea i know i thought it was permanent sadsmile
It only makes the victory tastier
Yeah thats what it is for so people who get WL really did work for it
only if they know abt it they dont market it in the USA
oo we aint ready for that one wow
im like rank 460 rn grind dont stop
just another channel for people to talk to because cave 1 alone is too chaotic
They are rewarding members based on organic activity so you do not necessarily have to be top 200 to win whitelist this accommodates for people that cannot be as active because its understandable that people have to work
wait so its not about ranks right? mods just look out for people who interact. But its kinda hard cos so many people typing.
gl bro just gotta keep engaging with the community and youll be top 200 in no time
A more chilled out version of the main cave
grinding deeznuts on ur face all day
its been awhile since last giveaway think youre in the clear might be better to sleep and miss one giveaway than be tired during theDev  active hours and miss 5
lmao no cap people be running it up in there
Hyxder you think my fan art is enough to get WL ? 
I tried working today and I got like 20 done of what I needed to KEKW But im lucky I work from home. But also yeah tomorrow I need to do more work tbh.
Well community is what sets the best projects apart. Thats part of the reason cyberkongz is the blue chip of blue chips
yeah man we just vibin together thats all
ya Ill just make conversations with ppl in general. no way i can be in the top 200.
What project yall most boolish about
I hope you do get it mods always look over so 
focus on ur work bro thats important!
Hyxder yes its a hard balance IRL
lol only?? at least you made top 200!!
thats brilliant theres 4500 memebrs in the discord my boy
sup cave 2 we lurking in the night!
Flaunting your green in here. How dare you sir! Jk looks good on you
So whats the difference between cave and cave2? seriously why is there like 2 caves and rage and chill? kinda confusing to me
I was just talking and then I turned green Kek
facts this project is straight 
For sure it is! I agree! Tomorrow I will be working more. I PROMISE! KEKW heartlove
how much passive income yall think we gonna get from this nft
im going to make some tea real quick. anybody want some??
haha true only safe when we see that green
Making pixel art is not ez . Im tryna figure out shading . Thats the hardest part
1000 been on it all day but i dont plan on stopping
Why we have the cave 2 already?
Thats why I have a lot of faith in this one never seen a community this active before
hahah this sound pay the finance on it for sure loll
Has to be enough to pay my California mortgage
probably some chai. chai hit different
server is growing  cave 1 got too hectic
This is how it always goes. Next thing you know you have every lambo
fr and chillcave too is such a vibe
its gonna be WL only sale wont be a gas killer
wont be suprised if we get cave 3 within a few days  cave 2 is popping  the server is growing massively
Lol  think cave 3 will come soon then
I spent all my money trying to bribe a mod for wl but he scammed me
sounds good  keep up man. im just relaxing at home ready to some stuff
Me too! I want to learn how to make animated pixel art
egg tart yes maybe itll slow down enough to have proper conversations
its like 0132 AM where im at so i wont be able to get my hands any bubbletea rn sadly
exactly dude idk man this channel just feels more relaxed than 1 lol can have more conversations
yeah cant respond to everyone sometimes haha
i cant sleep if i drink tea at night. tea makes me wide awake more than coffee ever does lul
im sorry ser we just met cant call me a beauty just like that. pls dinner first
hahah you might need to move from cali haha
I work at a middle school. Theyre extremely easily perplexed
thats why I enjoy this cave more than cave 1
where theres a will theres a way
not really yet but would be cool haha
My bad ser I will gladly take you out on a fancy dinner. But I expect a reward from your end afterwards.. Ice cream
They could cut the slowmode in half and it would still be manageable Im guessing
yeaah fr we need to put chai tea on the map
Kururuvi tea really calms me down. so perfect when im just chilling. but it never makes me sleepy
wingedwyvern handsup cryptopunk4156
ya it doesnt make me sleepy too it makes me wide awake lul
they did at one point and it was xD
Hahaha. Keep increasing taxes over here   Dr.Gino tea so late? Chrysanthemum?
AirWolf i got vanilla and chocolate pick ur poison
my bad brother ill just move across the globe to go get some
!CosmicWyverns Rummy159 thats true
234pm why would you be...lkol i joke i joke
Dr.Gino just get a aardbeien theetje
Yeah the other channel looks like bot cancer
tino so why did they put it back if it was manageable?
I have a chai latte with oat milk every morning. Perfect start to the day
do you have some matcha inhouse? although it keeps u awake sadly
3500 Wyverns def need more caves
still trying to get wl before its to late
girlfriend is coming guess i gotta cut this one short
its not bot cancer its organic just too intense man XD
Madge haveabeefwithmediscordstatic peepoSipSpinHypet
Havent really checked out chillcave tbh imma have to vibe in there a bit later
you got this just be active and youll have a chance at receiving a WL
lol i hope been here since start
i live in canada man...our taxes have always been high...but we get health care lol
i dont someone else did i was correcting him 
when did you buy your blue punk sir?
Do you make yours at home? I live in the literal middle of nowhere so no place to go get one haha
VeroSolo yeah man i love tea at this hour. idk what that other word means 
egg tart nahh mann its just tea. but i do like to put some sugar in it
sorry i never had a punk before. Hoping this would be my first one of many
Oh no... There are bots in there. Theyre super easy to spot. Just find the ones that dont reply to tags and only post NPC messages that have nothing to do with any topic being discussed or constant LFG. Usually they wont ask questions because when they never reply its a dead giveaway.
So many grey names maybe i should get greeb one to mix it
i dont really drink hot drinks tbh i like tea occasionally though
Isnt your discord profile picture an alien crypto punk?
ngl lowkey I be dirty as hell in pong
wow thats a lot man i dont put sugar in mine
youre under arrest! you have the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law
yea i also too am dirty in pongo
Stolen!! Discord should have a feature like the upcoming twitter one with nft integration
yeah i pirated it from google LOL
ping pong is so much fund...but we call it table tennis haha

you have the right to an attorney if you can afford one one will be appointed to you by the state
i really like cold drinks more refreshing
do you guys also put some honey into your tea?
TheCoaster I saw that yeah. okay. okay.
straight outta of a coming of age movie loool
Hey freddie nice to see you again. That would be a pretty cool integration system
i love iced and hot drinks depends on how i feel tbh
Shouldnt you have gotten WL w the first 500? shit wrong person. Meant to reply to the guy you replied to. lmao
Charging phone 3 times a day thats how we do this in faudi town

jtp12 imma be here for the entire weekend just you know. Hope to see you guys here with me 
plenty of opportunities left as well

I started shooting people because they live on the other side of town. Weird how it affects everyone similar but differently
you gotta get far enough ahead and not get burnt out. you will see me
the series is so inspirational right?
mutant gorillas now!! lfgg!! you bidding?
true! top 200 or not the real ones will be recognised Im sure 
Idk man your orders may be a lil too wild for me! I respect the unique choices tho!
yea no invite contest so all growth is organix
oh damn i wont be most of the weekend  hope they call this list tomorrow and do another xD so many spots left
how does the whole bid thing work and when does it go live?
whats your to go bubble tea or milk tea or juice tea order??
people get news of this and it will grow fast af i am sure
I swear they locked the server why we cant hit 5 k
Yep thats what i like all organic
if you give us some info we might be able to help you with a plead deal
I mean you could 100 throw the real community statement out the window. That would be a bummer...
Anyone wanna donate their white list? Ill give them a taco
Breh bus comes in 10 mins it brick outside
Its already live for the stakers and its just a regular english auction. Public rounds start in 2 days
If i get two tacos i will think about it
oo yea...if they said invite 10 people...this disord woudl be 40k...but thats not what this is about..the mods know what they are doing....5k organic is insaneee
idk where to bid!?? is that happening now???
popcorn actually sounds good rn!

Yeah if you have a MutantCat bears are coing too
1 taco and 1 crunch wrap supreme deal?
Ye hard to remember emails to my 10 dc alts
you think they are going to call it tomorrow. if I sleep im going to lose the top 200 spot easy
exactly lol...invites are fine...but when it grows that way its different
yooo does the bot delete messages with fwords?
midorima89 Im into Guild of Guardians and Sipher. Didnt get into illvium tho . FREDDIE  I hope so! Want at least 1 of these games to pan out!
does cave 2 have any bots? cave 1 is kinda hectic
21 wbu?    GBMM I will think about if you can maybe add a little extra it will boost your probably
i think no one is inviting their groups because they wanna win the top 200 challenge lol! why growth is chillin.
been in a server that has like 30k cos they make u keep inviting end up buying a brick! lmao
liquidity for a few new projects that i can get in early. i did a 11x on the one i had. Will buy back in soon. Love the project still.
The roadmap for this project is great the sneak peak for the game looks good
damn you in early bro! good for you
Ok fine Ill add in a diet root beer
no bots here we organic up in here
Dang you making me hungry. Dat crunchwarp supreme tho
Yall see the punk that sold for half a billion?
I just invited a few people! But yeah it could slow things down knowing its fully WL sale now and theres already more members than spots
gm guys pepecozy  havent slept tho
well did u managed to sold at 2.7?
We have to invit a maximum of people !
U wana say there are bots in cave1??lets punish them
yessir brother Shroomvision Going Galt  we all early!! Aye gang Coach Greg
yea server just ends up with a bunch of bots
very early we got this! just keep pushing and letting the vibes flow
No invite competition for this bud just real organic community
haha yes this thing going to be bangin like orcs
yes  dun worry i have good strategy.
The messages are hilariously bad.
Elea no we dont. No points for it...
What is this are you reciting things rn
holy crap can anyone do a dragon flag here i can barely do tucked ones
14 of the members are all on is pretty insane
mods are aware of them and said theyre monitoring
yep2 everyone does i have one to in order to grind into a cyberkongz
Go to... honestly I love a good simple taro bubble tea!
I know thats pretty basic but it really hits man 
ehh the big boss super saijin is online
yesssir Shroomvision Going Galt
is a dragon flag where you hold yourself up to a bar and become parralel to the floor?
They are only monitoring their league game
most likely.. i only invited 3 of my besties
I cant even do a pull up anymore
nope thats the front lever. front lever is way harder. dragon flag is a good progression to the front lever
Hahaha every once in a while I read your messages and have no idea what they mean
good choice but too mainstream 
in a smaller server its easy to know which is bot i saw a few before they talking to themselves and never reply to others
the admin is a drongball z fan...must be anywyas...thats too lit...thats how i know im in the right project loll...well that an a bunch of other reasons like their roadmap lol
so sad this is 12 sneak peek we definitely need more
I aint no hipster if it s good its good!
HENRY Time to bump midnight kids 
could you explain how the dragon flag works? these calisthenics moves seems pretty crazy looks like it requires alot of upper body strength
yeah httpsopensea.ioassetsethereum0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb9998 its wild
lol man people can write scripts l      ike that eh...that is isane....im not a bot...i talk to everyone lol

Its like you just ripped out my heart and stomped on it multiple times
Half a bili theres no way. This is some money laundering no cap
React with  if eth is going to 1000000
A worthy investment though punks are only going up
Since youre in here do you know if this is going to be a modified kongz model?
nah bro buy a floor. 500m for that nah son
Well maybe but... Nft is kinda to good to be true sometimes
We can do this!!!!! Lets gooooo. 10eth for us! p
thats 20 of cryptopunks volume no way he could of bought aloth of floor punks with that money
nah the trick is to stand on your head not your hands
hahah i just hope the mods believe me lol
always vibing man. This is the place to be
Yeah how does that even happen...
Bruh this aint gonna be a return in a few years my man.
so excited for this project  hope they add another 100 to this activity giveaway
its going to last forever then Kek
Good to hear buddy what time is it for you now?
yeah im not really sure i just knowmthat these wyverns are coo
yeah that wasnt a good investment lol
There is nothing in announcements why u scamming
whole lotta activity for these spots zz
imagine having the liquidity to sit on that haha
its probably like a big statement i wonder who bought it
I dont see new announcements tho is something coming?
Honestly I do not know since Im not a dev just a mod. So the extent of the information I have when it comes to the project atm is the same as you.
I wish I had the time to commit to posting every time the slowmode ends but....
That will be very nice  Hopefully the team will increase the slot to top 300 active members instead
guesses on discord members by the morning
hahaha no time for proper sauce cookingneed to grind
Honestly I wouldnt be surprised to see wyverns pull some crazy numbers 
Robert  they been selling like crazy..you ever look yo see?
Might just buy 1000000 in doge coin for the meme
Wheres my man tmam I was in the middle of reading his story my man.
it def could be.. theres a lot of sus trades on OS too man
Mod lets talk business  how much eth for a green name
When is your morning? Its 11am where I am so tomoz morning Im guessing 1012k
lolol they could these wyverns are pretty cool looking creature
mods always looking out for people with organic activity so dont feel too bad
haha i dont think youll have problems
the nft space has only started to take off who knows what will happen for the industry in the future
dont worry bro genuine interactions are better anyways and the mods are watching and blessing ppl!
Congrats on your whitelist buddy
What can you even do with that much money? Its too much lol
Ahhh ok. Thx anyway. Do the devs drop in and interact regularly?
I will give 3.42 dollars rn for a green name
haha fair enough....i was gonna guess 7k since its all organic growth...if the mods say invite 10 people for whiteilist...this discord will be at50k in no time
one hundreddd milllnionn shibaaa coinss
Yeah they were here a bit earlier they seem to just be away atm
actually im not exactly sure who the dev is i just joined the project recently hahaha
Im just hoping to see some more sneak peaks! They are so dope 
Im so tired lol been here all day
I dont have Eth to offer but how many memes would it take for green name?
lmao they give it to u then take it back
understandable have a great day
Very true genuine conversationinteraction is the way we need to go to build the community!
Nice its 1.14 am here gotta sleep soon lol
bro dont diss his lawn mowing money
Even with organic growth this project is awesome and Ive sent a few invites to my friends so they dont miss out knowing invites mean nothing here
Would be sad to go to the jail for 3 bucks
get creative man and post a nice meme it might get recognized pepePogChamp
Man still dumbfounded half a bill wish they spare me like a couple mill
absolute throwback to my childhood LMAOO
Anyway great to see so many people with different profile picture  we have got a great diversity here!
exactly...a project with 5k discord members and no invite contest....is equal to 40k...so basically they ahve 40k in 2 days lol
No worries. Ive been looking for a project with a modified kongz model for awhile but even the ones that look like they may be turn out not to be. Im just hopeful its not another anonymice model...
just gonna order takeaway wyverns more important...lmao
Im just shook. Did someone think this is dollars? Does someone just have that much ETH?
Andrew27 Space Apes awesome to see0

Thats the way to heaven aawyeah PeepoClap Dance
best cave. VIP cave some might say. big vibes only of course
To see your rank userank not !rank
Hahahha just like to grab a drink on thursday or many lol

the vip cave thats a nice name for this game
there is a group hacking all of them.
Thanks dude! keep it real bruh! hehehe
Andrew27 Space Apes Very good bruh!!
Dr.Gino hahahaah VIP we are dude!!
yeah me either so gotta just be in here and hope im helpful enough 
25 eth lost from Jungle Freak discord got hacked so nuts
oh damn you can use the mee6 leaderboard I pinned it 
i guess but just checked evosnail discord and i dont see any mint pages etc. where is it hacked exactly?
Im off to bed its late catch you all tomorrow 
these discord hacks getting out of hand
Ok ok you like to get wild on a thursday night eh 
ight man good luck at work. go get that bread
Coach Greg fr youre not lying  
Cant believe people fell for it though  but definitely sucks horribly for them. It was literally posted 100 times in same announcement and had a lot of dumb errors in it.
must of got back control feel free to ask mods.
Tbh i just want to see the dj i dont even feel like drinking tonight
And organic grow....... It will help the community build the strong community and we can beat kaiji
Yoo congrats to the new whitelist gang well deserved!
Goodnight fella! Hope you have the sweetest of dreams 
vibes keep the world spinning salute
You going to sleep too? Good night kisu
yeah but some people get too hyped and forget to read properly. and then they make mistakes. it happens sadly
everyone make sure to check fanart
i know atleast like 5 discords that got hacked over 10 eth lost
Im just saying it works too not only rank
Be careful about hacks guys so many discords getting hacked currently stay safe and use 2 factor verification!
Fuc I forgot the name of one I saw yesterday getting hacked
Dr.Gino definitely horrible for those people but man. You have to be careful especially in light of that its happened multiple times in past week
most of the NFT floors are taking a big hit right now alt coins messing everything up 
where is that one thats scary mate
it was as a collective hella people send eth to this address thinking it was mint site
oh shit nice dragon with an extra chromie
ah it seems they keep hacking the discords through the bots or something. yikes
glad to see some post modern art lovers
the most important thing is to note down the mint date if they magically decide to mint earlier then its 99.99 chance its a scam
Yeah Ive been seeing a lot of it as well. Security in projects definitely need to be thought of a bit more
yah bruh yesterday! So happy about it!
jtp12 Machine sometime need to be repair hahahaha
I hope you have a good time tonight!
discord was hacked and fake owners made out like it was an extra project people rushed into it
yeahh man thats why its good that people like you try to warn the people before its too late
Appreciate it if you like edm search up malaa
some of these hacks seem mad sus looking more like an inside job than a hack
hows ur night been going robert?
FREDDIE wow. these discord hacks have been going crazy
100 I also think the server shoulders responsibility for announcing these in faqselsewhere so that its posted. Slowplaying is good but given whats happened its in everyones best interest to show some cards. Glad that Wyverns did this right off the bat
I do like some edm never heard of malaa though 0
you too homie. love the positivity
French dj give him a listen wnt regret it
Anyone one you referring to specifically?
Got hacked fake mint website posted in announcement

Yessir cave 2 breeds whitelist babies  
v1 Thanks a lot homie i hope you thrive soon!

Plenty of room for the WL! Grind hard  stay active and youll be rewarded big time
Oh wow just now aye. congrats my man!! how long have you been in here?
Wow. Cant afford any more. Gotta work with what I got now 
Congrats! A lot of cave 2 whitelist winners i see! We really do hold it down for the server

arceus  Cosmic Wyverns lmao really how was it? rolling loud just hasnt been the same anymore
time to see how cave one doin Kek
Thank youu so much! I love you guys and this awesome community!! 
eth is going up everyday. And somehow connected to the sales in NFT space
hahaha yeah heard it gets up real high think gas is like .02 eth for mints which is kinda crazy. but i hope eth 2.0 comes out soon and solves this problem for us
Thats awesome! Way to go cave 2 people
1Tapi0ca  yes its not a grind if the reward is good community and great project
Thanks my buddy! Ill never forget you 
Love to see the people getting green names congrats to everyone!
which sets did you watch for rolling loud? i heard joey badass polog and jack harlow performed today
yeah eth going hard all time high right?
you reckon??? NO!!!!!! i am broke!!!!
This whole flash loan thing got me slackin on my grind
Yeah i saw you was talking about the football game on sports
Ayyy it seems to be more calm in here hows everyone doing?
Good thing i got my eth bag when it was at 600
yup. cave 2 is where its at. all the cool wyverns chill here
Anyone make new friends in the NFT scene?
Cave 2 pops peeps in here are great.
You deserve this. Congratulations!!!!
Yea eth is really soaring high after shib run
Yeah i wouldnt even know how that works though.
Is it a complete different coin or what 
Welcome to Cave 2. We are celebrating a few new greenies
yo whats up arceus! werent you at rolling loud? how was it
Yess mate for the past 2 month all i have seen is gas price increase no sign of slowing down more people jump into this space
Yesss i got some cool friend since joining nft ppl from other country
i only got onto eth when i learnt about NFT
but yes seems like all time high now
Happy for you hope its my turn very soon haha
SO many friends! I talk to my NFT and Twitch friends more than IRL friends KEKW
saw all of them jack harlow was fire but im j trynna go home now LMAO ill share some pics in music
congrats kenny on being happy for him
Oh yeah hahaha love the chat in there. I had to step out for a bit.
PSA for anyone checking your rank consider using rank instead of !rank 
Congrats man! So many greens popping up now Im glad everyone thats active is getting them
Lol I talk on discord more than my wife
We need some nft experts to drop some gas knowledge on us newbies 
me2 only reason i have eth is because nfts
awesome man jack harlow is pretty lit i would love to see him live! i cant wait to check out music later
Yeahh! Lets do some party and danceee
the green is starting become all over the chat this is wonderful
Im gonna keep trying to produce more and more art  let creativity manifest our minds! Lets celebrate Cave 2 once im done
Lmfao second time doing this to me  you dont want to see these people win?
A lot more nft friends than real life i can relate
how long did it take you fam to get the green name? congrats again!!
how have you gotten into drawing?
maybe its the market correcting itself too many people tapping in will saturate the market bricking everything
Let us in cave 2 know once you finish PESHeart
hmm i never looked into it either i think so
I do love me some jack harlow! That boy is too cool 
i think polog is also performing he has a lot of boppers
He aint ever peaked he still getting cuter
Hmmm then it would be a completely different price than ETH? 
lamo he doesnt like seeing praisers what a shame atleast hes keeping track for you LOL
Robert  jack harlow slaps did you hear that song with him and pooh sheisty 
HENRY Polo G one of my favorite all time rappers his old songs are so good too
I tend to just let my mind write. If you think too hard  you end up walking on fire and burning yourself with thousands of ideas. 
BoNFT Will do! Do we prefer GIFs or Pictures?
We are at 4689 now wohoooo! Get your friends to join before it is too late!
Shd have bought more eth when low
it will probably follow in ETHs tracks and overtake it or maybe they let you convert it
Yess for sure we are in a nft bear market.
gifs are cool but do whatever youre comfortable with to rep cave 2 aPESPogSpin
We need a new system soon it seems like. Plus its going to be much harder for people to enter this space as time goes on if the gas prices are too high.
v1 sup dude! haha hes always congratsing me congrasting other people
Polo g better days verse is fire
Man thinks if hes 1 lvl above me he can ignore me
word he made 2019 mad memorable with his album
Hyxder congrats on being rank 1 level 20 for now..
Ive hit level 8! Lets GO! Hyxder congrats  youre crazy . I see the Jpegs angel been trying to get in since day 1
Hmmm idk if i have what is it called?
Yeah i love that channel too haha
Nft make profit and make good friends.......

HENRY and people barely found out about him until pop out with tjay boy he been making hits for awhiles
Robert  the song is called SUVs give it a listen it goes hard have you listened to the song  who want smoke
Is the tactic to have a girl profile pic to get responses? instsntly changed pfp once you got the green name. Think smart not hard
Glad youre loving the community
I wish i had some eth right now 
I asked where u from and got silence in return
Maybe coz ur botting and dont read msgs???????
I wonder how they come out with the level up algorithm
Shisyuo Thanks  mate  whats up?

Wasnt hating I respect it. Congrats on WL though fr!
Yessir the vibe here its amazing
Looking at some inu coins right now put some money into Mononoke Inu 
the important thing about grinding here I feel is actually to also actively contribute to the space. through marketing or other efforts. For the communitywe will win
i gotta spend a whole 2 months of work for 1 eth 
I promise you the only one that thinks im a bot 
I actually think ive heard this like once before its pretty good tbh

hey kennayyy nice to see you again my nigerian brother!
I study online and have to discord
Be happy that we have this community regardless of rank
I think we do what we can to help and build this community.
BoNFT  .000067 was  .000085 yesterday we gonna drop another zero
If only it was on coinbase haha  you have to use uniswap 
what method do you use to make your chicken? is it dry?
But being in top 200 feels good
yeah bro i been here from the start LMAO
no not really but im keeping him because hes really really cute!! the floor for froggie frens is 0 ETH so you can copy just gotta pay gas
HENRYYY chilling bro im tryna finish up YOU but i keep getting distracted
ahahahaaha. the pocket change is worth a bugatti or what
I think shiba will be going to the moon.....
fosho it definitely guarantees wl too but you gotta be willing  available to work for it
Sorry and tying to look upthe roadmap and faq

HENRYYY kinda like the og henry here tbh
Whats its price niw ? It was below 1 at a point
its not easy for a lot of people! i have trouble because i NEED to concentrate on one thing for it to be good but multitasking makes it so that both of the tasks that im doing are subpar works
Damn did you mint it presale? Was it cheap at least!
Gona make it the biggest crypto scam in the history
Souhate theres like at least 50 whitelisted in the top 200 list so you guys can relax! its okay to sleep
Fugazzi I have less Ys in my name
randomcbosh i minted it public sale it was pretty cheap
im just cooler my twin is a looser
Faudi tell me more ab dr fauci coin
oh wait i was totally confusing it with another nft that was 0.1 was confused xD
usually i just stir fry it. could bake it as well tho
first of all his name has 3 ys and everybody knows 3 ys makes you cooler
Oh thats sweet! Did you mint it cuz it was cute or did you have high hopes for the project 
Nah nah i have my own strategy its called dump and dump
Doodle ..... 13 fp last time i checked strong fp
Yo im right behind you on the rank haha
oh interesting okay. just hard to keep engagements for long periods of time
If you gonna make the token icon that pfp its going too the moon
Who thinks that the market is a fugazi now
chill man. no dumping. we here for the long term
nah dont believe him. remember in life that more is not always better. sometimes one is just enough
aight i expect to see you right behind me when we both rank 50s right
thanks bro but i just wanna be safe
Hell yeah we hold this project! These wyverns look so dope actually!
Congrats! Hard work pays off they say  Ive been in this discord all day long
Nah it should be the girl from other pfp to attract new comers
Yessir lets see who gets there first hahaha
Guys anyone from UKIreland here?
Yess they have strong community.....
Hyxder would you rather have one Wyvern or 3 wyverns?

No i wish i have ....... To pricy for me now i cannot afford it
how you doing soldier? hanging in there?
fading 0 its getting hard to read lmao

Doodles are down a good amount maybe a good time to pick up 0.o
Weclome to the VIP cave enjoy your stay 
Im hoping to get a deskstop soon myself too
would be nice have multiple screens

Gas literally put my nft trading to halt so I guess its chit chat time for me n the rest as well lol
That sneak giving me the batman vibes

the gas price is extremely high. its crazy
NFTs are a lifetime. Forget gas  rip it!

HENRY I agree its part of the game
nah not gonna mint anytime soon there arent any projects that ive been interested in with close mint dates
Of course sir i have a beautiful camaro haha
Yesss need to be wl in that kind of project.... But doodle is not hype no one knows before presale and public sale.... Suddenly 15 fp
U can send me 1 eth for exclusive presale of 2 faudi tokens rn
Me patiently waiting for eth 2.0
If the project is special like this one just gotta suck up the gas i guess 
what are other projects are you looking at right now
yee I use to own a lil drift 350z but got rid of it during the start of covid bc the vq scene was annoying af LMAOO
probably some big guys behind it that only started shilling afterwards
Not true.. Its very hyped before the sales actually..
lmao when u turn green  congrats g!
yea very strong. Lots of whales in the project so I dont see it dipping TOO much.

Solely focused on this one ATM. Have others lined up for mint coming soon though

Same here! Super interested in Hapebeast at the moment just because im a hype beast myself lol
That is the most factual fact! Cave 2 gang for life
kucas Love demon slayer too man!
cave 2 actually has a nickname its called vip cave if you know you know
22??? Bruh Im eating for a few days with that
hahahah lmaoo.. that real nice i reckon this is the cave but chiller.
I was expecting that to be cheaper
feel you bro i drive a commuter just because its much more reliable tbh
Why cave 2 named vip ? I missed anything?
Yeah foods here in philippines are cheap lol
this is the way no reason to waste money on a commuter
how much does that weigh do you know? maybe ill try it if im ever in the Philippines

pretty much im sorry you wont make it for whitelist pepepray
Nice bro. NFT will likely be able to fund all the trips you want to take in the future p
will the doctor clean my ears for me?
woooowww this looks really good
Hahahaa! Come here in the philippines!
Im heading to bed yall. Everyone have a GN
nah chasiu is pork shoulder instead of pork belly both still very good tho
dang 109 so far i hope i make it
yeah its probably bad lol but i feel dirty if i dont and that q tip in your ear just hit different haha
tummysalumi yeah your doctor can help remove ear wax from your ear
JIMEK MASTER21 can i ask how u know about the hip thrust cult ?
Good night! I hope you get some good rest. YOull need it ArthurGun
Aw man would you like my spot dad
we are in a decent amount of same servers!
ayy you bullish bro  lets get this dough. but not from wynerns naw what im saying  long term hold fo sure
o watt i never heard of that before. ok ill ask him about it
You can buy doodle with that thooooo
i think its more habit than anything then i have never cleaned my earwax out so i dont feel like i need to clean it
niceee whats your opinion about fish tanks?
that pork belly looks bussin even though its not char siew
a GP or general practitioner can do that. Its safer and after cleaning its spotless.
trust me you made it already basically lol youre in good enough hands good job btw
kucas  facts you just get used to cleaning the q tip its too satisfying to stop haha
I just stick some tissue in the ears to soak the water after showering idk if thats bad though 
we are definitely going to make it 
yeah we need more sneak peaks asap 
i think bot commands is broken lol
i feel bad for people that cant eat pork
randomcbosh probably not think its fine to have some water in there
so much work maintaining i had one and it was always extremely dirty
Sorry every1 got good food in my cam roll!
sire great hold man cant wait for the execution of the fourth quarter roadmap gonna be so lit esp with metaverse rollouts
My boy trying to make everyone hungry in here 
Wonder if it will surpass bluechip doodle thoughh Seinic whaddya think? p
i always want the knicks to win cus its my city
oh we are talking about the nft called the fish tank but can imagine yh. dont you need to clean it monthly or something? like empty and refill etc
that looks delish! reminds me of the big family meals with a huge roast pork in the middle
stay hard comrade. dont let nobody else outwork you.
ong fish tanks are so much to maintain i gave up on mine LOL it was literally too much and getting kinda expensive always miss waking up and seeing fishies tho
vegasm  be sure to get some rest every so often and hydrate pls 
kiran559  some of the slots were hand picked yes by the mods those handpick were those who were active and engaging within the community
sold one at the reveal holding the other so dope brooo lets gooo
putting all my hope into this project fr
Get some rest mate! I seen you around here a lot today! Dont go too hard now
make sure to worry about your mental health first and get some sleep!
I believe we will. Only a matter of time and remember the best part is being part of this community. We need to be hardworking to promote healthy community.
hahah i didnt know but you have to clean every week
v1 mine always had the white diseases with my fish it was so expensive to maintain
Of cos. U cant compare meka to a pfp project
Methodson I wished I sold one pre reveal too
Heyyyy that makes two of us go go get some food!
sounds like something david goggins would say
wow so many green roles going out congratulations all!
im hungry tooo what do you want to have for your breaklunchdinner
got some food workin rn for myself 
yup im a big goggins fan. stay hard is his quote
everyone jus get sushi or pizza
ah yes first thought weekly but wasnt sure so said monthly. draining and refilling every week sounds like an absolute pain. you had a small one?
Thats great advice we must outwork everyone and ascend to greatness!
randomcbosh must go until green
I had parrot fish and my sucker fish always died to idk why. its so hard to keep it clean especially without the suckers
god damm sparkle in the sea of pfps you have blinded me 
sheesh that looks nice ryngtchln
never had it is that a leaner cut of pork?
actually On my way! for some grub i think
Oh? Youre referring to meka right?
very much hyped and they havent even started giveaways  yet!
awh man that sucked sad to let them fishies goo
Hyxder question sushi or sashimi what do you prefer
man yall really like pork! not my fav at all
so fire bro u making want some now 
I respect the dedication but we have plenty of time! The snapshot isnt anytime soon dont worry! And theres so many whitelist spots to give 
ive never had pork knuckles either. wonder how it tastes
Sashimi with a bit of lemon hits diff but i usually prefer sushi
hahaha when you said stay hard i instantly thought about david goggins i love watching him! he is very motivating
Omo its actually quite nice to see many people replying to others here 3
Yep! But the crispy skin is the dealbreaker here!
ah yh those suckerfish are cool no clue about fishes in general tho
roast pork knuckles with a drizzle of black berry sauce glaze over the fats and a side of bacon mate
Yeah its awesome! such a great community already with such small members
I think CW will be a league of its own depending on how we build this community. A project can have the best roadmap but good project deserves good community
were not here to put down other projects man i think both are nice projects
yep hes the hardest man on the planet
same here i like throw in the sashimi every now and then 
PREWISH  whaa you never heard of sashimi  its just raw fish sushi
sashimi gets old quick. Need that seaweed and rice
I believe its raw fish you can usually get it at sushi places
its basically sushi grade fish like salmon tuna eel etc
Thats right i cant wait for the giveaways to pop off 
i cant believe some of the feats he has accomplished he is a crazy man that is for sure
randomcbosh but only 200 for active I think
My convo above wasnt abt CW fyi haha
AzyanDraws check this out roadmap
Nah nothing about putting other projects down. Just comparing with similar project
Id love some sashimi right about now
Bro I love sushi but my friends never wanna come with me 
yeah but getting sashimi from a good ole place will have that thang melt in your mouth i ate from a fancy restaurant before and man it literally just melts in your mouth lol 
mitchel  get some its the best 
Damnnnn thats sick what is that suppose to be?   
come to canada we get sushi espz
as long as its fresh my friend 
you do them or thats on you? if you do tattoos it looks really good
If i get 100 likes I will consider getting a tattoo of CW  that I own in the future and will post it here how about that
that is sickkkkkk bro. when you get ripped itll look even nicer

yuckkkk... i remember when gas was half that price even e85 lol.
hell yeah smells like corn haha NateDawg yeah im in NJ i couldnt imagine cali prices
Still not helping for me.... My friend could eat it as it is
its been some rough couple weeks
The aesthetic of this art is top teir
whole fish cooked yeah those be so good ive recently had butter fish and that just hit different
Wei of course soy sauce always in there never forget the most important part
do you know why its been so high?
I heard youre not meant to mix wasabi with soy. v1 dude butter fish is SOO good
yeah gas is tax here e85 is usually cheaper though
that sounds so good right about now living with myself i stopped eating fish like that besides salmon
your friend is crazy kek  usually its at least mixed but some soy alone is nice too.
yeah its so sad  needs to chill. I spend so much per tank in my truck now.
the right way is to use soy suace sparingly and wasabi too
wow joker.. i like joker character
about to draggy this shit see what its running caleb
You made yourself or what!  sick!
Hahahahaha yeahh ikr... I cant even stand with the smell
i suggested it like 3 times but oh wells i want a food gaming and a gaming channel

Yeah you dont have to be here for hours at a time come back every now and then 
NZ scene dead honestly everyone wants mids and lows

IYKYK Clean  hey dont wear yourself out by chatting in here be sure to take breaks ebvery now and then

Yea lol  everyone gonna get everything lol
i made some garlic noodles with shrimp was fye af

RYU namanam v1  yes for sure. probably will come back in an hour and see how vibes are
nooo i wish bro thats pork right??
i just ate some spanish food it was so good

Are you in the WL for bearx mate?

Pretty sure they still gonna moon
aawyeah aawyeah 861687609490276382 aawyeah 
thats dope! maybe easier than the hype releases
yeah super fire had pulled porrk for lunch tho haha
wow is that fried pork strips? I love those
We still manage to sell a lot of hype pairs we managed to get 30 pairs of seafoams and 13 pairs of shimmers which was an insane cook
Im in it too I  just wondering cuz I like hearing peoples perspectives regarding how the team dealt with the hacks aftermath
IYKYK Clean  yea dont beat yourself over too if you lose a lot in rank  can always come back and get right just chat and have fun with it  dont think of it as a grind
Anyone wanna teach me how to cook
Unless eth heads to 5k 6k territory
they are getting paid back out of the pockets of the other white listers so no worries
Yes I am. I wasted my entire soul in there. Took a day off from work like actually used PTO KEKW and I ended up sending like 44 messages an hour over 9 days. NEver doing that again
Yeah heading to 7.5k sooner or later
ooo yea thats what I meant  those are soo good
actually been checking those whitelisted. 
they have huge message count but most of them are kinda spammy
appreciate all the support yall
youtube is a good teacher I think
I only be cooking and eating chicken
really? so bearx not gonna make any profit
Ah man I hope nft projexts will adjust their prices accordingly when eth goes up
theyre going to make profit lmaoo
i make a mean omelet lmfao maybe some chicken rice and vegetables but thats all im good for lol
i hope they are getting paid back asap i would hate to get scammed
they will definitely be over .5 eth ea lmao
Man thats rough I got lucky and was quick enough filling out the trivia google form
Any cooking YouTube tutorial channels yall recommend
BearX should still do well I reckon
yup no worries my guy hope to cya again later
ico ooooo i love omelets bruh them aare always so good what you only know how to make omelets LOL
The thing is tho I do feel bad in a way but also there were SOOO many red flags. There were no mods they were kicked channels were deleted channels locked announcement going out every 5 seconds mint price and amt were different and many more. Like....  But raised the mint price to get their money back. heartlove
they are they increased mint price so they dont have to pay it themselves lol. HENRY kinda greedy of them but ohwell kek
Dachshundwizard  Twitch  especially people that minted more than 3 pure greed
basically lmfao my pan flipping skills are off that charts no one can compare
yea they should do good sucks that their server got hacked
boiled some yellow noodles from the asian market  cooked the shrimp in the pan then minced minced up some garlic and sauted it then i threw in oyster sauce fish sauce and a lil bit of sesame oil and the noodles last finished with a lil bit of lemon and parmesan on top
Yeah man feel bad for everyone whos out of pocket because of it but they made an announcement saying itll get paid back
Wow this is dedication man. I am sure you will be rewarded!!!
just gotta slap some spinach on that
wow thats kinda messed up to do it like that wtf they making people pay for the admins mistakes
spinach omelets just hit different tbh
but not much people know that tho when a user just suddenly wakes up and checks discord and see that a bot makes public sale life its believeable to those new to nfts  most people new to nfts just go straight to buying
ico youre gonna have to post a video lol id love to see that 
frostyflakes  better than cave 1 where you have 50 people spamming different things lol in here you can actually have a convo with others
Hot sauce goes great on so many things 
has anyone played new world yet
pretty much yeah greedy ppl tbh since they also have secondary market profits from fees they couldve paid it from their own pockets instead
There were a lot of red flags but if the project wanted to regain their credibility then they had to refund the ppl who got scammed because at the end of the day it was the teams fault and they should take accountability. Glad were raising mint prices to compensate those who got scammed tho
aawyeah aawyeah 861687609490276382 aawyeah aawyeah 
yeah more convos here than cave 1
yea that is true you kind of expect to trust the announcements so it throws people off when its a scam
yeah? havent got a chance to touch it yet
Oh yeah for sure and I can see that side of it as well. But idk at least for me if I am gonna mint something I would have followed just at least a little bit of it and not thrown thousands of dollars at something with a lot of red flags. Like I understand your point but idk...I hope you know what im saying KEKW BUT we are refunding them so we all good.
i watched my friends play takes 2 hours to grind 1 lvl 
Why is every server getting hacked these past few days
can we get a giveaways or triviaquiz
For sure also better to keep up
Yeah its crazy. Hope you r g bro
Zeratul Id like to know that yoo
congrats on congratulating the congraduate
Hackers have been getting more clever bro
Just wait brother its just 2 days since this channel born
man tbh the chance of them refudning everybody is a slim chance to none only project ive seen do it was creature toadz and that was because the hacker refunded them all of it lol 
BoNFT  yeah esp when its from announcements where you least expect it and when its coming from a mee6 bot
Dachshundwizard  Twitch   oh is it true that everybody who got scammed will be compensated?
Man idk but big server gots hit 
Feels like a group hitting them
everybody shhh wyvern master is back  havent seen him since the morning
No we already decided to refund them  the WLers took a vote and we decided to raise the mint price from .035 to .05 so we can get back MOST of the money.
i feel like that might affect their community as a whole. bearx might brick because of this but idk
true where you live? nyc is mad cold rn
Bro usually 5k means nothing for other projects.... But this 5k make the chat looks like 90k
bro im straight freezing in my room. city temp hit diff
Yeah nobody stops here love it haha
thanks man i spent like 5 mins writing all of that kek
Yes. We raised the price of the mint to raise money to give back funds that were lost by the scam.
Its been raining here as well. Awful weather lol
I agree Id like to see the team use some of their money to fully compensate everyone. They own a project at the end of the day and its up to them to take accountability they would make it back anyways after the mint price was raised
this hack or the secondary fees? because secondary fees will be there regardless like all the other projects.
RYU namanam because these 45k ppl are mostly legit with no invite competition and its only day 2 so im sure it will increase
Organic things are really much better
awh i see hopefully they pull thru with their plan and refund everybody its hard to come back from that and its kinda fishy idk using sales to refund everybody cause nobody knows if theyll actually pull thru with it
vegasm  sick drawing ive seen you pumping out a lot of artwork i hope your posting them in fanart  would love to show some love
bojangles  yup were just gonna have to see tho maskbyte and had the same plans in mind
Well guys Im giving up on the top 200.  My kids and work just keep me away too much.  Good luck
when are we gonna be able to mint i we 200 top?
Dachshundwizard  Twitch  bojangles you guys founders of bearx?
Its cos we are wyverns fams every1 excited on this project 
no no  I wish! KEKW We are both just on the WL after losing my soul...
thats the dev read up in roadmap
Yeah no invite makes everything better hahaha and no lfg and wahmi here
LOL I wish. tummysalumi theyll be fully compensating everyone?
I will stay in chat but end the grind
2 days is enough to bring us to 5k strong 
Dachshundwizard  Twitch  yes ur here to lose it again lol
ahhh big congrats!!! how do you think it compares to wyverns?
In whitelistinfo they have more information but theyre going to screenshot the top 200 at a random time and those will get WL. but if youre just active you have a chance of getting WL
LMAO it might seem like theyre the founders but i think theyre just part of the community in it
Kuri  hes one of the admins in here
Dachshundwizard  Twitch   thanks for the informatiuon great to know i left the discord a while back but good to hear that the team is trying to come back from this
haha those discords are fun in their own way. hours of lfg and wagmi
can you explain me that please bro
haha yeah im joking but I spent so much time in that discord like every waking moment. It was torture KEKW
Hows that bearx project? good? or rug pull
Take easy my friend just enjoy and keep vibing
AirWolf not particularly but designated survivor is great if you are interested in government and the shooter is my all time favorite netflix series you should check it out
now youre gon spend time in here with us haha welcome welcome !!! great to see others from other communities coming together
you can still get picked out by mods if you are helpful and standout! dont give up
Im sure theyll be able to do decent still. All it matters is how they take it from here
Yo nice BAYC btw. I am jelly AND happy for you. 
idk how it will recover after what happened
oh cool.  i thought it was limited to the top 200 grind
im not from anywhere cold but I actually would like to move out to where its colder or rains more
Will check it out. Been watching the show YOU

you is sold wild but i couldnt finish season 3
Thing is if it was public mint Id be a little more worried but since its presale only most ppl on it will still want to buy
I appreciate it yo! Thank you heartspingreen 
nicolelodeon  nice name. I miss that network ArthurCry
i just read about teh wl thanks
yh it will be hard but if the art is right they will hype up regardless
how cold is it over where u are?
tummysalumi thats what i like to hear
its gonna do well forsure hardworking team and community! the organic growth is crazy
such perfect weather this weekend here where i live!
i might have binged it too quickly. i was so annoyed of the characters by season 3 i couldnt realliy handle this guy jjst letting his addiction run loose all the characters started making me upset and so i just stopped watching it
Yup likely only those who are confident and passionate about the project! Which is good
You rly dont wanna lose that top1 heh love to see it
Missed out on kaiju im not missing out on this one
you number 1 while im struggling to hit 200 kekw
broski was rude to me so now am not givin a chance
not sure how organic bearx is but it sure grew fast
same here bro it will be my first mint hope to get it
do you take cold showers cause those be the best feeling
Brausoto  yup also i hope you read the part where theyll randomly select thos randomly from the chat to be WL if theyre active and friendly with the community
perfectwizardbs hell yeah a perfect balacne but cave 2 is far better lol 
Loui  same delay as every other channel 1 min
big facts kaiju discord was off right before the drop I was so sad
me either this group is booming!!
No 1 can rest until snapshot i guess hahaha
v1 cold showers suckkkk until you get out and you feel amazing
yeah that one wasnt as organic cause they had inv comps! did you get in bearx whitelist?
Good luck man! We can make it bro!
Yup gets rid of a lot of paper hands. Plus every big project has its story before minting eh
was close but nope their contests bugged out for me kek
what were the other nft stories that made it pop off?
cave 2 is where all the sexy people are xD
Yeah agree... Cant wait for mint date hopefully my name will be green before that
its actually called the VIP cave here because we are just beter than cave 1
no no inviterank competition mate
its starts to be 80 degrees in april and 90s in may til end of september sometimes LOL but then its chill like 7060 the rest of the time
not paper handing this at all. Staking tf out of t
pls dont talk about kaiju they grabbed the first 700 supportes i think  and i was like in the 800s i was super early in the didscord but it still wasnt enough  i really wanted a kaiju too 
ico  man exactly even after a hot ass shower youre gon feel cold regardless lol 
perfectwizardbs  yeah cave 1 feels less genuine more convos going on in here and cave 2

Brausoto  lmao haha im sure youll be able to climb the ranks easily if you stay active and engage every so often
hahah ya man art does look sick tho cant lie i love the pixel art nfts !
What project? I can see discords of 80k due to invite comp
Love to see people recognizing this as the superior cave 
GM brooo lets keep lvl up together

Ryu Vibe yh i do i was so close to getting one too
Yeepp chill out and enjoy the vibe hehehehe
Anyone dressing up for Halloween
thank you  im addicted to this discord. love it
Im in Oakland its usually pretty moderate out here but its been getting hotter
I have seen projects that has difficulty in selling out due to fake supporters. Not just because of gas
Honestly im becoming pretty addicted too  
So many chill peoepl in thecave2 
tummysalumi Chegg is really the mvp 
yeah im going to keep going im almost top 50 rn
Exactly! We all going to make it!!
chegg and 1 other 1 i forgot abt
sick where ya get the desk from i always like to build things when i get em from ikea
caleb  yup im in the same area hell yeah it gets so hot here in sac its crazy but so cold during the winters
BoNFT  glad to see you tho everytime i here
cassie07  exactly projects like those dont get anywhere i think a project heavily relies on its community if its gon do well
yeah idk what i would do without it
Brausoto agreed a lot of great people to talk to
yeah moving more inland it gets hot as hell in the summer still terrible in the bay too sometimes for summers
Not at all cause they strong and they fly
Just having some beers and chilling how are you
Yes seems like we are getting a lot of new joiners. Exciting!!
redbull help me tonight to get into 200 top pleaseeee
chegg is deadass the goat they helped me so much throughout college lol
sadly no i only play DOTA 2 haah
think that project will probably still grow more
nahhhh its just a standing desk
damn u used chegg like that too?
yeah i gotta go but ill get it when i get back
bojangles chill vibes . doing great mate thanks
hey hows it going great to see you here again always reminding me of my sold doodle 
Brausoto  just chat away be active and engage with the community  dont think of it as a grind itll tire you out
yh maybe. looks good so as long as they keep the project running good it will be hard
I have also noticed that ones who are successful are supported by blue chip groups like Kongz. They got alpha
yeah when i was back in school! i used it all the time
lovely broo whay about a bluntt lol
i never was in the discord how is the community pretty good?
cw jeez probably not define good
I used to play it but met a toxic team so taking a break lol
i joined too late to give a good opinion about it but it sure was as active as this discord
Im low on weed about to roll me a joint
yes i dont quite like it tbh not flaming you guys but i prefer Dota
I suggest you get the phunks pfp. In that way youll be real. It got history with decentralization and
Im gold 3 anyone wanna queue up?
yeah following big alpha groups is a big plus but sometimes theyre not always right lol but most of time they know what to get in 
MoneygettinQuentin  project looks insane be sure to check out the roadmap and sneakpeek
Kristopher Lukas good hbuBrausoto  puff puff pass
thats good man this project gonna be sick im stoked
imm valo player looking for a boost to radiant llol
yea thats what my friend said too haha
dota too hard for a casual league player
so am i and since we are early i think we are going to make it this time
you are so god damn right bro thanks for the advice
ah valorant. i peaked immortal 3 in that game
tummysalumi holy crap youre insane
this project is gon be more than sick lol def gon go far for sure community and project looking very solid so far
Wei your def gon make it  project is still in its early stages  and only about a hundred hjave been whitelisted
yeah i hope so! we are pretty early what rank are you at rn ?
Bayc is deeply rooted with alpha info as well. You must have maximized your profits from being BAYC member
same hit imm 3 like 3 seasons ago. wanna boost me?
is it ? i have no idea haha but LoL is more to technical skills i felt most skills are not targetable it allows you to better judge the movements of enemy. thats how i felt from the short experience in LoL haha
Looks amazing thanks checking it out now
yooo pass it haha i just took a few dabs. prob go for a few more sooon .
im rank 185 so in the range atm but 1 sleep and im out so gotta keep going 
that right there is a savior lol people who always share chegg were goats but chegg has cracked down lately on shared accs lol chegg was so clutch during college
Brausoto yup hope to see you here just have fun 
I would but I dont think we can queue up together since there is such a big skill gap
im playting that right now haha
tummysalumi  peaked immortal 3 in val thats insanity
nah micro play is a lot harder in dota than it is in league
i will buddy what about that ape it it yours?
ye when i couldnt lend the account to people anymore i could still help people if the5y send me the chegg link
yeah especially with the concept of kiling ur own creep to cancel
yup i believe i should make it with how early i am atm
PREWISH kek say that to kishu ill go ham but not that ham
sheesh i wish you good luck in your game!
they gave me this in s7 for hitting chally lol
i feel that bro im literally right with you lost a bunch cause i had to work today! sucks but imma grind back up there tonight
Hahaha didnt he go like 40 hours ? Lol
v1  any other info you got with this project that currently not publicly available? I have a bit of info regarding the team but havent really made a deep dive research
thank you grinding out the battle pass right now
awh not much but the gaming aspect and 100 whitelist sale already got me hooked ill be sure to update you with any information i find
its been quite a while since i last touched LoL
Am starting back at Dota i stopped 6 months ago haha
will need to recalibrate my rank
yup real easy to get kicked out but you are still in top 200 right so you good
PREWISH yh really went 40 hours straight. crazy as hell havent done that in ages
Yea the gaming aspect is something different alrwdy
PREWISH whered you get your username btw?
121 right now thought i was a little more towards 200 but i think if i sleep ill prob lose my top 200 spot
its too much of a commitment for a casual palyer like me unfortunately 
dota still have bigger prize pools for tournaments than League?
the challenger jacket they gave out one season was pretty cool too
as of right now you can check whitelistinfo  but theres other chances as well like being active and engaging with the community and youll be hand  selected by one of the mods to be whitelisted
SPIDERKid hey welcome to the community if anything you can use the language channels down below
tbh with that rank i think you will stay within 200 if you start after you wake again
Man crazy maxed i did was 27 hours 
Dachshundwizard  Twitch  its a secret 
its the only game i played seriously haha
yuuup im gonna try and get to like under 100 tonight gonna be tough tho
Not worries use google translator
Just enjoy and keep vibing mate
that reminds me of bdo if you know what i mean. did you start playing it bc of shroud ? lmfao
Thanks my man. Yeah the gaming aspect made me ape in and go long with this proj. Our convictions might be solidified when they release more info
well see what happens! im probably not gonna sleep for a little while anyways so i should be chillin D
thats really cool purple is my favorite color im very impressed
oh that was setuks drawing thats nice
yeah. that was the previous season i got challenger. wish i got that too
wish i were talented at games like you
yh 40 is truly crazy we getting old sadge  used  to be able to stay awake for way longer
fluxray just chill with us and time will pass fast
Nice art bro. Make sure to tag them on twitter with the correct hastags

Souhate  yup im excited to see even more art and theres only been 3 teases so far i cannot wait
cw  oh yup good to see you back lets get back to where we left off lol
Bro what are the odds I have a homie that hit challenger off singed too
cave 1 definitely more wild haha
major props that champ is annoying
its mostly the same people talking luckily and its so much easier to hold convos with less people
i hate the 60 sec wait between ms lol
PREWISH i think the secret is a lot of energy drinks and i dont really drink those
damn im a hardstuck gold jungler haha
dont think of it as a hard stuck you gotr this
tummysalumi singed was op back then
cave 1 got some hectic vibes theyre chat way too quick for me to have a actual convo lol 
Brausoto  nah its actually good the 1 min cooldown prevents spammers and lets genuine convos take place if it wasnt for it youll just countless spammers
Yo I was like plat max my whole life im doodoo
ill probably make it to diamond next season at least i hope i do
what did you play? you seem like a twisted fate player
just looked up and ive been chatting for the past hour... jeez how time flies
saaame   ohwell i guess we just keep to our semi crazy sleeping schedules
yeap thats so true  1 min got it good 
you sound like a tf player that hates tahm kench
yeah forreal bro! tried to go back in there and have a convo but no one responding back with questions lmao how is ur night going
Wut you mean? Like WL? Just hangout and help others be part of the community and have fun heartlove

pepelmfao sleep 6 hours grind 13 hours lol
im plat in valorant but we gonna be up there one dya
thats what im about to this for wyvern
what can twisted fate do against tahm kench? realistically what can he do
whitelistinfo  be sure to read this also the mods are actively watching and are handing out whitelist spots to those who are active and helping in the community
929  a1234  its a perfect balance honestly
Ryu Vibe my night is going great so far yeah with cave 2 you can actually talk to people lol 
Infintrus  oh yes i used to first be in the chill cave also im doing great 
Oh there is chill cave. Wyverns will make it sizzling hot. Lol

Yeah I think im comfrotable with cave 2.
jhin is fun to play i like killing people with his fourth shot XD
same to you also and everybody else in here 
Seinic  oh really yeah the chat was more chill  but its not as bad as cave 1 lol
Ytinashnid  it got too hard and everbody got too good lol or i just suck more 
Definitely the bots pop up there more often and chat moves to fast. This more conducive to chit chatchillin
agreed! feels like our own little community in here
remember to throw your Q first then 4th shot so the 4th shot does more damage
Nice nice i might go to sleep wake up early lol 
Nah youre probably challenger stop capping 
Favorite youtuberstreamer anyone????
nah make sure to throw your q and miss your w and then flash and youre not in range to aa so you ult and you miss all your ult shots haha or is that just me?
it most definite does lol our lil community in cave 2
Ytinashnid  the highest i ever got was silver 5   i wish i was challenger my team was prob holding me back
team was def holding you back your true potential is much stronger
No fav watch too many people because of nft and crypto space haha
hahaha and then you get flamed by all your teammates and then you try again and you get angry am i right Syd Rogers  ahahhaa
do your thing doubt they will already do it today so should be all good
Everyone has their own preference! Thats why theres multiple 
Thats pretty good man! League is lw toxic anyways 
How about your fave whale guys?
man league had so many trolls and toxic epople back in the day it was horrible lol if you was low rank it was gon be a tough one league was the most toxic game i ever played
Ytinashnid not even lw lol mfs were crazy on that game 
If I had to pick one my boy Mr. Charlie White aka Moist Critikal aka penguiz0
just watching some crypto videos and hanging out how about you?
kbbq sounds like it would slap rn
everyone has their own preference  haha
I like pizza rarely have pizza in my area
can you air that here to canada lol
whatcha up to right now mr syd rogers? funny name btw
korean bbq always hits 3 i peep that sneaker con shirt in the background 
bro hot pot is the bomb especially during winter
True people at my high school grinded in league bruh I dont know how they handle it 
PREWISH I am at 144  making dinner now tho KEKW
true but i grew up eating hot pot my whole life so maybe i am a bit biased
haha i think sneakercon were giving those out for free in the bay area one
Nah imma have to go with kbbq all the way 
I like crypto banter most wife changing money lol  
Dachshundwizard  Twitch  wow nice mate
Is that the facebook short videos? The young sneaker trader with his dad and sister?
fluxray nice. I need to watch some videos. I got into NFTs which got me more into crypto but now with the explosion if meme coins Im like ......should I be exploring this more? But yeah doing nothing....I worked a 12 today so just relaxing a bit
League was a straight pain in the booty  dudes were straight grinding in that game
cw ooo youre from the bay area  great to see
kucas  hot pot always hit too tho but imo kbbq  hotpot any day
The usuals up you know the vibes the usual dusual
hot pot is a lot better but i think kbbq give us more protein
Syd Rogers ahh me too the usualll
How many people from the bay area in here?
i dont know what youre talking about but if you find the video can you please share?
kbbq takes too long bro i like to eat my food asap
theres a lot more variety for hot pot i get tired of eating beef and pork and chicken if im eating for 2 hours haha
paying to cook your own food XD
yeah i feel that  ive been loading up on information since i started getting into nfts and somehow ive landed in the alt coin space
bruh I could never get into league that game just didnt feel right for me.  I tried to learn a few separate times over the years but the community is also way too toxic to beginners
Ah I missed them. Id like to visit taiwan again
Dry hot pot mad good lemme put you on
my mans is all about the gains 3 you can get all the protein you need with all you can eat hot pot haha 
tummysalumi  whhaa doesnt it take while for it to cook in the broth at hotpot too
League was good but it got boring fast
if u eat the same amount of meat its the same amount of protein
gm! where are you from? its 9pm for me lol
Good to see all these bay area folks most people in cali are just socal
yeah but only eating sliced beef at hot pot is kinda boring ur kinda forced to eat some other stuff
maybe some of the seafood stuff but the meat takes mad short to cook you can dip it in there for like 15 secs and itll be ready
catrollypolly 2 monkeyrollypolly 2 dogrollypolly 2 
We cant send links in here I guess. Im sorry its not sneakercon. Their name is sneaker hustle
DRY hot pot??? please tell us more
Favorite car everyone? We need to start a debate here
gotta put in some prawn paste or fish noodles that stuffs the bomb
Alright you got a good point there

Hopefully we will all be able to make it. Will be rooting for you! Lets get the green name together!!!

Ill be grinding 200 if the real pfp owner grinds lol

yeah thats why im going to other channels to talk haha
im bullish on your chances bro i cant stress how early you are enough
should be yh also managed to get into the top 200 so im quite positive about it 
No announcement. It can just start anytime I guess
Haha if i had this nft and sold it nft grinding would be my only job

We are hitting 5000 soon! Excited about it. Hopefully there will be more slots up for grab as a way to celebrate us hitting 5000 members?

Yeah this definitely look like the next big thing. We are early!!!

Hey OG whitelist when did you first hear about the project? Jw because envy you. hahaha.
Oh I thought that was your suggestion. Also I was kidding not talking shit. 0o
Robert just got his WL today. Big congrats to him
Wow thats a good deal! 5k a day is amazing!
YOO maa mann!! howve u been buddy? hope u get the WL here soon dude.. so all the guys manage to get it here n we mooning tgt g rainbowhappy
Nuggets with mcflurry ? weird combo huh
I heard Cave 2 is the best. Hello
the secret is in its utility you generate 10 bananas a day. 50banana. floor at 100eth. is about 5 APY higher than any bank
Hes not kidding tho. Banana is cheap rn.
that was some good ass cinnabon
I hope so as well! I have been alright! Just had a late dinner and gonna get ready for bed soon and we chillin!
hows ur day or night going? cave 2 is lit
about to go to mcdonalds what should i get?
idk how to describe man but its can compete with mcd
Yeah will be looking forward to that!
haha do you guys have any fear of delisting daily or you guys have some strict rules in the community to follow
Its true. Cave 2 is for VIPs. Welcome relax and chill.
hahaha love the good stuff. lol
Peter T. off a friend hahahah got lucky..   kennayyy niceee i hear.. congrats to him !! Dachshundwizard  Twitch  nicee dude excited for this week tbh.. LFG FAMrainbowhappy
hey how is your night going so far?
I knew it! Cave 1 tried to fake it but I knew it all along.
better french fries with mcflurry lol
hello all i am back hows everybody doing
I feel you but noodles is a hard task for lunch dont you think? Just get a solid rice dish with protein and veggies tbh. Would never go wrong
id say all of the genesis kongz holders have diamond hands most of them got in really early when they were like 110eth floor
im not from singapore but what is that?
yuuup haha what kinda cut you usally get
yeah me too i need a cut for tmr night
Im looking forward to this project AND this weekend! wlcclfg
i just got one like 4 days ago  but i want another one already lol gotta stay fresh
Seinic  mcspicy i mean we have a spicy mcchicken in the staes but mcspicy sounds crazy lol 
! Cosmic Wyvern  Broking T  hey great to see you here too 
Why wouldnt they just sell if its that much eth each?
Whats good about genesis kongz besides the daily gains?
ull get ther fam!! just reach top 200 and ull be WL.. ill be waiting for u bro
yea me too so im looking a lot more into NFTs that generate tokens
Floor is 122eth. Still on that? 
8BitLolitas most people in projects like this dont seem to understandknow about the kongz model. I thought everyone came for the same thing but no. Its amazing
I love mc chickens thats my go to mcdoanlds order
Sweet!! thats a great friend. Love to build those kind of connections. Thats why Im here and will like to be a part of this community. Appreciate the info fam!!
yes im booming are you THRIVING too?
do you see that in offshoot projects like kaiju kingz but i guess the alpha group in gen kongz is really worth the hold. its like additional passive income over and above bananas
have you guys tried mcchicken and replace the mayo with big mac sauce
what lv are u atm bro? i saw u chatting like 247
Great community there. I am sure there are a lot of things we can learn from you!
I want fries with honey mustard
u will fam!! as long as ure genuinely contributing to communities.. u will attract ppl with positive energies.. 
I havent Ill try that the next time I go Sound bomb tho
Im 134! we got that covered! Im on my way! 100rainbow
they see more value in the NFT than pure monetary gain. u get alpha from other members and u can breed baby kongz for the other member who dont have genesis. usually get a tip between 1025 bananas 5002500 USD
honey mustard sounds good for fries but spicy mayo sounds better
I would like to mention I am also thriving
honey mustard? thats kinda weird
Yeah passive income is good bro. We got lots to learn!
cant stop  wont stop  game stop
Sounds a bit strange but I swear its bomb
i prefer like sweet and sour or barbecue
20 pc mcnugget and large fries with an oreo mcflurry
Forsure my man!! Appreciate the knowledge. Where are you locate fam?
thought it was gonna taste nasty at first but it was pretty good
Thats sick. The price per banana is so high. I wonder if they did that on purpose to get the hype surrounding it
Ketchup is og dont even play with me man
bet imma get that in a few minutes haha
yeap ive grown to love mustard hahaa
Syd Rogers that is good to hear but can i get a haircut
Yo I got you  lets get there together. 100rainbow
the price is high because theyre very smart with their burn mechanics
Ahahahaha yeaaah me too !!! Cant wait for the next season 
passive income alone is boring but pair that up with a high functioning community man thats the sauce
oh i boosted the server brotha nothing too special
bojangles  your time is coming my friend
Season 1 was awesome man. But it kinda gets repetitive after season 2. Still a good show nonetheless!
yeah Ill cut your hair pull up homie
Sorry im new here whats a burn mechanic? Is it the people that are smart or the devs?
thats good to hear man we kickin it back in here
Thats right somehow yeaah still love it. Is Goldberg right here? Lmao
ayy whats your favourite genres
yes bro if u click on the arrow next to server name u will see  boost this server
Sometimes I do feel boosters should be appreciated a lil more  but of course they cant boost the server and do ntg
the devs so the token isnt continuously in circulation. when you breed you basically delete 600 bananas
man he must be matt stonie to be eating all that in one go lol  anyone else notice the whitelist number going up slowly
Wonder what everyone is doing in between chats 
upstate new york kinda far bruh but maybe ill come up
holy cow if anyone play league i just pulled off an insane play i stole 2 drakes back to back!
Yall are so cheeky in here i love it
is coo just come thru free haircut on me
yep during the bull run it was 120 per banana now in the bear market is floating between 4760
pretending to be a functioning worker in the corporate world
Any film reccommendation besides it?
wow u probably just won the game for your team if you did that!
you dont have to pretend ! once youve made it here  its time to say good bye to corporate world
i have a baby kong ser no genesis for me out of my budget range xD
So many new wyverns coming in exciting stuffs !
tummysalumi i bet he gives fire fades
keep a good vibe brotha we all will get wl in no time haha
wow you on discord? focus on your game man ahahah
got damm it i wish some one hook me up on a feeding tube so that i can have my hands on the keyboard all day
yeah i got you with a bowlcut bring me the size bowl you want
ha bro you are right we can do it haha
randomcbosh shoot my instant replay wasnt on
i have 10 of a genesis right now on WGK i generate 1 banana per day DDD
how many does a baby kong yield?
this is time for the lunch guys
DAmn... shadow play failed you?
medium sized bowl because i have a medium sized head
Who in their right mind would breed at 120 per banana lol.
Does anybody gag when they brush their tongue and how do you guys brush your tongue if you gag?
damn okay you like turning the lights off eh?
thats some decent money per day
lmk if any yo homies want cuts too
gdi all i ever wanted in life is  a bowl cut penguin ffs they be out of reach at this point
during the bull run it doesnt matter what u did or what u invested in ull most likely make money cuz everything was just going up
tummysalumi yea haha his ult is sick
easily about to go take a nap and then we will be at 5k
Sheeeesh wanna slide to Cali and give yo boi a fresh cut 
lol if u make it big one day you can get one yourself
i might need to head out for banking soon  see u in a bit
I like how they e gonna focus on their lives now Ill get into it soon
50 per day not bad got some other NFTs that generate tokens too.
im lowkey feeding but hopefully i win haha
lmao just take a break and rest up  dont always gotta be on discord
yo what Syd Rogers  you can cut hair mind sharing a ig page if you have one
Yeah best season so far in my opinion
50 a day is good. Some people can only make 50 a day
tokenomics are gonna be the lifeblood of nfts
thats wassup i used to cut during highschool for my hustle
its a good side Hussle got like 3 homies that do it and make good money
Kaiju cool cats mutant cats Headdao as of now will probaby buy a Neo Tokyo when i get some more money
yep deposit to pay for another shoes haha buy myself a birthday gift lol
good luck boss! i quit those games haha
yup it is already lol more and more projects are adopting em 
cw  youre gon lol dont beat urself over it you got it !
Ryu Vibe man i remember letting my homie cut my hair back then lmao we was all basically rest subjects cutting hair looks fun tho
Ohh! Yea those are big names. Kaiju kings especially
whats up yall back n better than ever
MY mannnn! you carried with the dragon steals!
rewarding holders of nft with token that can be use for breeding buying new nfts utility and in metaverse gaming and they also serve as potential sources of income
yeah got a couple bad cuts from when they started up haha but now they hook it up so its sick
dipped to like .5e recently. its defo a nft to look into imo but always do ur own research
oof i dont know why but im a big fan of tapers they look so clean but once i get hoem the haircut is basically gone lol
Ryu Vibe lmao fr it was cool back then how they started with us and got better as time went on
yeah its crazy how life changing nft is!
teamnopaint brother i think i was nice. ill send a pic off my phone if i can find one
Ryu Vibe its really fun to do plus u can make good connections from it
thanks for the wyvern community in believe in my jungle skills haha
i cut all my boys in college rn
yo what 50 a day? geeez i can finally put food on the table and feed the fam
true without those dragon skills the game couldve gone different
Indeed! And good news is we all still early!
Hahaha were all early in the nft scene
which chat is better cave or cave 2 7346pepehmmm
great to see you here still just got back and youre still at keep it going 
holanihao 50 a day is a lot it just adds up a ton overtime which is great

i started learning skin tapers recently actually
ez bro!! LFG btw ur pfp looks damn sick.. from fanarts?
yeah connections are everything man! v1 definitely  leveled up haha
guess this chat would be a lil bias haha
yo where did whitelist chat go?
bro u ever tried Suko in Jakarta?
well this is cave 2  so my question has a lil bias to it asking here haha
i got my penguin to work full time discord so hes doing great
honestly! they already confirmed season 4
I think the chat here doesnt move as fast most of em are over at the main chat
Checkout the faqs for a detailed breakdown of the project plan and future milestones

There is a couple that live far apart from each other and the boyfriend wants to send the girl an expensive necklace through the mail. Customs however arent the most trustworthy so he has to lock it inside a box with a lock. He cant send the key to her as they will take it and open the box even if he sends them at different times. How can he get the necklace to her safely?

uhh iono bout that never liked broccoli cheddar soup whenever I had it
lmao facts all the homies gotta eat 
CharlesVFs  ill have to try that never even heard of that 
ChonBean  be sure to check out whitelistinfo  and the mods are actively handpicking those that are active and friendly with the community for whitelist
check the announcements and the faqs for WL details
how you had broccoli chicken noodle soup before?
Yeah literally unintentionally fluffy  lol 
nah he means when you boil the broccoli and drink the water
Most of my day was school but I had a bit of time to chat in here
I dont even got energy to be salty so i guess im save on that lol. But we just chillin so its fine
oh that broccoli soup I love it like that
u dont have to put cheddar i think its good on its on with a slight drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and balck pepper
just watching you right now im nearing the end of season 3 rn omg
yeah its tough being active when you have a job or school i think thats why majority of the whitelist will go towards those are active and helpful in the community
cw  just late night talks and snacking lol
thats good ! you in HS or post secondary ?
is this any different to the cave ?
i either boil it or bake it. it tastes a lot better baked tho.
like broccoli cheddar soup is not it for me
then its all good hf with league
nope just another place to have a convo
Ive got one hand on lunch and one hand on ma phone
good stuff make sure to live it up! goes by quick once you are out
my profile picture is just a cute froggie fren 3
yea im trying to make memories right now and then work my ass off after school cry
ahahha ok i guess then just splitted people to control the traffic
make sure you dont eat too much salt tho! too much sodium is bad for you
no not really but everyone here is gon say cave 2 is superior ps its true 
Methodson  multitasking on another level haha 
cw  ive been snackking on some nerd gummies and snacks lol
then have u tried baked tomatoes soup ? those are insane with some sourdough too 
just good old ripe tomatoes with onions  olive oil salt
whats a good late night snack rn
Aww sounds like you got it all planned  haha
We stay lit in cave 2! We all know the drill here
ahahha love it ..then  i guess i can stick to cave 2 
I mean if you getting money and having fun thatd be the best haha if you can hussle stuff in highschool do it!
oh yeah you right I try to keep it low
okaay u already take a lunch bro?
Im literally stuck on this chair for now X
Syd Rogers what else you like to eat
Lol bro no u wont if u get more rest!
Ive made pretty good money through nfts so Im just to fit fun and nfts into my schedule
hmm actually might make a sandwich
yeah throw them in the oven for 45 min at 250 celsius. take them out and take a food processor and blend. u could add some vegetable stock when youre blending it
i like eating halal food with chicken with white sauce and hot sauce hbu
thats nice love japanese eel. Always a facc
Have you checked out chillcave ?! Some ultimate chillers in there 
Yassss cave 2 da best ..atleast im able to keep track of the replies in here  unlike the cave
Yesss im finished. U have no work now?
Syd Rogers have you tried the popeyes chicken sandwich yet so good
Yeah.. juz love sashimi and jap food! Top choice for lunch today! Wat u having mate?
hoping that I could make a living in the NFT space. Its something I love doing and I know a bit about it
ooo youre back!!!! Waa never share
I had Indian curry earlier! Delicious with loads of fried chicken
same here also i love daytrading
what do you usually order with dry hotpot
yea but chik fil a sandwich is better change my mind
yup but cave 2 is better lol much more chill in here
BoNFT  thats great to hear glad to hear that nfts made people some good money
Huatella  another sashimi lover  sashimi is the best
HENRY  what they got dry hotpot how does that work
Ive seen a bit but no way they stay as lit as us here 
ooooh yeah curries are always yumm ..which one did you have bro ?
thats the dream man look into crypto as well if you havent  or just regular stocks you can make it forsure just gotta put in the time and if you young even better! more time haha
beef and lots of it and some fish tofu and some veggies haha
Syd Rogers i will change your mind  popeyes chicken is huge chick fil a is too small
Wow.. probably i will have them for dinner! Roti prata!
lol yeah seems like I got no excuses already huh 
Yea im into crypto ill start looking into stocks
doing well actually just looking at the markets things are looking strong out there
whats the age range for everyone here ? always curious what demographic gets into these
just get 2 chik fil a sandwiches whats your next point to debunk chik fil a  popeyes
its made szechuan style and cook on a wok its really good you definitrely gotta try it out since a lot of people never had it before!
Same here my fav ia tom yum and pad thai
Oh you have no idea! We always lit fam 
good luck with that and this project hope you get WL !
oh yeah nice ..where r u from bro ?
yoo my sticks just came about to dog these bad boys
those scechuan dishes are bomb af if you love spices they dont necessarily have to be spicy
i swear when popeyes first put out the chicken sandwich it was huge nowadawys that thing is the size of the chic fil a sandwich lol 
HENRY will be sure to try crazy how i never even heard of it sounds good too
Syd Rogers  oh boy enjoy your meal i love chic fila  esp their sauces
but that is not cost efficient also the popeyes workers demographics make fried chicken better than the chick fil a demographic
thanks PESHeart hoping you get wl too. Even if I dont get wl I genuinely enjoy talking to people in this discord

Andrew27 Space Apes  ooo sick space ape i like that the market fell hard on those sadly

eHy guys just wondering if you all heard of this project called CrowPunks? For some reason i was sent a raffle ticket. Anyone got the same?
oh man you are making me hungry with that skewers
Yeah I lived in bkk and studied in ISB when I was there
what makes the fuzhou wonton different from a regular wonton
Nah Im not into collecting cards at all 
HENRY  I had a friend who said spicy mala was too spicy and he convinced me to get tom yum worst mistake of my life
fu zhou wontons are so good have you had fu zhou fish balls?
I have 4hrs away from my kid now. Omg thank god

pork intestine is one of my favorite foods but i know some people find them weird
How to get wl will someone tell me
it feels weird thining about eating intenstines but they taste so dam good lol

Syd Rogers  would you ever try those ghost pepper chili chips like those challenges i hate spicy and i imagine if i ate that i would die lol
i havent had a normal sleeping schedule in a long time

that new dune movie is very worthwhile the first of a number of films it appears

Dachshundwizard  Twitch  woww 80 bucks thats od bread man nice!
what if youre on the taxi or something and you miss a good entry
im a fry cook at my local fast food place sometimes I manage the kitchen
530 am... you get paid more or no? that is some weird time

TheWalrus057 yup the movie was sick cant wait for chapter 2 to com it felt like chapter 1 was so short

This grind is for real  why am I spending so much time with it lol
Just started last august. Still so much to learn. I hope im on the right track. Haha.  How bout u?
HENRYYY  is it bad that I find it easier to grind at work? At home I have dogs and a toddler who require attention
what has nft done to us??? u know whats worst...grinding is kinda addictive!! u say u wanna sleep but u be still typing!! lol
hell yeah i wanted to do videography for my career and still do it but feels like thats more of a side hustle now
Because you are unintentionally fluffy KEKW KEKW
yeah it gets pretty cold out here! luckly summers are super hot here aswell so i get a bit of both. 
cSeemba been into them for like a month or less super intresting. this project gonna be big i think
Nft is changing our lives in different ways! 
100 i dont have anyone bothering me at work
U are grinding in the metaverse
ye its in the middle of nowhere
come on wyverns. where the energy at?
coming out from sac in cali what part are you from ??
Ryu Vibe man the summers here in cali are extremely hot i hate it literally feels like a sauna when you walk outside sometimes
Awww is that the criteria to fit in this deal X
dont give up on that my brother struggled for years and then one day things started clicking. If you keep trying its like standing in a dry field flicking a lighter. Eventually you are going to get a reaction! Now he has a successful video business doing commercials etc
just woke up energy is low rn lol
Hello guys come on to clear communities love it
heeyy guys lets keep this energy
We are all! And it is going to be worth it!
Haha i was going to bed 30 minutes ago but im still here  i cant stop
Lolol. Nice. I just gotta grind thru my morning stuff then it leaves the afternoon full of discord.
appreciate the advice bro! its more of a mental  losing motivation type of thing rn. just gotta kick it into gear  tbh

And Angelmisa  I need to figure out how to become fluffy as well. But I unintentionally. So idk if thats possible?
Yeah literally this space were communicating that is X we need help lol

last night i said i was going to bed i stayed an extra 3 hours and still woke up in the mud.
My brother went to sleep already  he was too tired from talking haha
Well my friend apparently Im unintentionally one therefore subconsciously doing so. No intention cant give you a formula to that  sry lol 
Two guys walked into a bar. The third guy ducked

thats why you stay hard and never sleep
LMAO its a trend for sure people cant help i cant even help it i just wanna chat a lil longer than usual haha
Vaansh  start us off strong cmon now 
Ryu Vibe  oh wow you shoudlve went i recently just came back from hawaii and it was crazy fun the views food and vibes were just amazing my flight ticket was only around 200 but everything else there was expensive af LOL

I think im rank 196 took a bit to get to but it was fun
Well at least you tried! Thats all the matters. 861688761661652992 861687609490276382
dw we all come out from the mud come back stronger and better im here with you all night
rpm40hoon I Wyvern dw not much cave 2 is much more chill tho compared to 1 can actually have convos in here
you got more where these came from?
U Wil nv feel left out in cave2!
I appreciate that brother I do thankfully have a very supportive family which has been great while I have been doing NFTscrypto full time. I dont know what I would do without them lol
what yall think about the 2 edits i did in fanart
Thats great man! All the support is very important. Rooting for you bro!
Sounds like a good time nobody wants to hold a convo in cave 1 where you from man?
thats awesome to hear for real. keep it going. im working a full time job and doing videography as well as NFTs on the side. somethings bound to hit you know. same goes for you. just cant give up
Whos feeling that they spent more than 50 of their 24hours daily on discord  lol
coming from cali how about yourself 
tummysalumi locked in tonight  might take a break soon tho lol i just ate and my stomach is starting to kick
absolutely with perseverance it is just a matter of time for both of us
ive always had some jokes in the stash lol
Want to hear a joke about construction? Im still working on it.
haha maybe a lil less than that but close
i actually work at an electric bike shop doing repairs and sales lol sounds lame but good ass money tbh 
TheWalrus057 for sure blessings coming our way
Wow full time. Im impressed this is such a challenging fast paced space right now. Keep grinding along buddy!
theres a reason were known as the VIP cave hehe i feel like people in cave 1 dont even care haha  
just straight vibing and interacting witht the community is best way to do it tummysalumi
The wedding was so beautiful even the cake was in tiers.
What do people call a blind deer
yup. A common problem in this NFT circle is the lack of sleep that people get. theres a lot of people that are just sleeping 35 hours a day because theyre staying up to grind but its really bad for your health the longer you do it!! health is wealth!!
theyre sick tbh i enjoy it and its the future so
You are good bro! Stand up comedy could be a thing you can consider?
Remember to follow httpstwitter.comCosmicWyverns
3500 Unique Wyverns. A ton of utility.

kucas yeah i feel you dude markets still high with them right now just cause theyre fairly new
Yup. If you feel as if its a grind youre doing it wrong. Try making yourself and others feel at home here  talk to as many people as you can  be polite and converse with everyone. Most importantly though enjoy yourself and vibe.
i cant sleep i can only think about wyverns right now
Wow only 1k followers on twitter compared to 4k on discord
lets bump that up guys and be sure to follow 
tummysalumi  me and you got the same mindset great to hear that preach it!!!
3500 Unique Wyverns. A ton of utility.
Why cant cows wear shoes? Because they lactose
are they easy to take care of as a consumer?
Syd Rogers haha rode on my first ebike in california too even though im from nyc
Me too. In bed but not sleeping. Pretending I dont have to get up for work tomorrow
thats some good bread right there
Yea brother. Im super bullish on this whitelist process. Its organic and honestly I first had joined for a spot  the grind.. now Im really hyped on being here and vibing with everyone!
for the most part yes but of course since theyre all chinese bikes there is always occasional issues
ok ok i give it you  that was actually a good one LOL
tummysalumi  yup same here organic growth is best way vibing just makes time go by so quick
no grind here just be active and engage in this community
Why did the walrus lick the envelope?
Because it was looking for a good SEAL!
that is why I licked it I will admit to this
still love it but hate waiting 1 minute to have a convo
you guys still grinding? WL still available for top 200?
This my favorite! Very dad jokey.
Have you heard the gossip about butter?
Actually forget it. I shouldnt spread it.
no grinding here  but yeah the top 200 leaderboard hasnt finished yet but the steaklthshot will be random so be aware of that
No grind here friend. Just vibing with fellow wyverns.
ahhh got it so you just keep hanging out till you get a wl sopt or you get too tired
Any 4 legs one and birds and fishes
doesnt lessen how much I love these and want em tho
agreed we should all be vibing here no grinding haha
just enjoy talking to everyone tbh i forget theirs a WL lol
I feel like Id like hamsters more if they were a little more aware lmao
thats something a grindr would say
Theres a whitelist? What is that?
Who said McDs lol my dinner sorted now
fosho! grinding just takes the fun out of it just have genuine convos with others is the best way
IYKYK Clean  never even heard of that thats crazy
McDs or KFC? KFC for me any day
Please give me the exact equation to WL zone lol
thats like literally everything except bugs
VeroSolo actually didnt end up getting mcd lmao cool you remembered
yo come on when the admins search my messages up they gonna be impressed stop blowing up my spot
we road the bus together to high school
I cant with both of them they end up both hurting my stomach at the end of the day theyre deadly haha
damn i gotta finish up my hw tho
I am more like popeyes type of person
What did the sandwich say to the doorman?
almost in that rank brodasss lets gooo
blob fish actually my gmail pfp lmao
RYU namanam come on homie hamsters prob cant even remember faces
if it was popeyes there would be an argument but mcdonalds would def win
the one and only fillet o fish!
Yep! I posted a huge french fries in your honor. Other fast food? 
ThePunter  McDs all day. Especially if that happy meal toy is 
what fastfood should i grab for lunch tomorrow
accounting. know anything bout that?
Is having late lunch now and still typing
whats the dateline though? like top 200 can always change
shell probably come around later. youll recognize her i think
kfc got nothing better than popeyes tbh mcdonalds got the most goated fries
Damn we dont have them here in Aus
since I was a kid Im a sucker for their drumsticks
awh no exact dateline yet its tba but keep up the work and itll pay off yeah top 200 is always changing 
xohu  stay here cave 2 is where its at
Just had a virtual hearing this morning. Starting my weekend this afternoon. Lol. Any weekend plans guys?
But I guess they are better at marketing or something hahah they are definitely are commonly foundknown though they dont taste as nice
When will top 200 get the roles?
theres a time and place for kfc fried chicken but popeyes stay goated until I eat too much popeyes
wow you still in here. did you take a break?
yeah i guess after we reach top 200 we have to maintain it
what they know about organic growth
Yo whats happening in this chat?
Where im from we dont have popeyes sadly. So have to do it with kfc and mcD
good job man. the grind pays of
but popeyes is opening soon here
yeah im an accounting major what class you takin rn
But I still like Popeyes more haha
dont forget boys all of us came in here natuarally httpstwitter.comCosmicWyvernsstatus1453970010691424262 organic growth is key!!!!!!!!
beeper  its like i never left ive been waiting for you to come back
superwasheddevil yup thats the idea remember mods are actively watching the chat selecting those who are active and helping in the community so its not all about being top 200

not much just different channel
honestly been here for awhile and cave 2 is alot more chill!
what would the punishment for possession of marijuana
just so people have another place to talk because its hard to keep conversations in one chat with a bunch of people doing the same
meh i just watched my sister play but i kinda played yeah lol  she would always buy those cash cards for in game currency lol
Theres just less people on here so youll get recognize a lot more people
Ooo. Thats tough I try not to indulge too much but I just had one from Black Tap in Anaheim.....sooooo good. Very thick and creamy.

cave 1 just flies by so fast hard to have a conversation with somebody
whts the difference between cave 1 and 2
Drugs related offence is take quite seriously here
cave 2 is for VIPS cave 1 is for normies
im so glad i got into nfts for real i was so skeptical at first
Yup thought so thats why I havent played since number 2 been xbox all the way after that haha
I tried going back to cave 1. Turned my ass right back around and came back here 
nothing just another place for people to hold conversations because cave 1 gets congested
IMXApe GUH777 BearX doing great man. Im bout to go to sleep. Wbu?
yesssir thats what ive been before LOL cave 2  cave 1 ong
not much of a difference fur fam but imo cave 2 is more chill and you can have actual convos in here
I joined a few days ago but didnt have time yet to really dive into this community. 
I hope that in the unrealistic scenario where i win the raffle i dont get disqualified
So this Is this the more chill channel

Yea same here! We both shall make it brother!
whoops replied to the wrong person ! thats good bro 
got mad homies to talk to you feel me
undoubtedly people who have no idea what an NFT is will be forced to learn when they log in and everyone is showing them and the news is covering it
This and Twitter integration gonna be massive for pfp space
Yes we are minimart open 24hours
Amazing stuff! Glad that we are all early here!
LOL heyy fur fam didnt even realize i learned it from there
kimjj  be sure to get some rest dont tire yourself out from engaging with the community
Syd Rogers i feel you lol i wanna get back to everybody

Indeed brother I love passive income 
lmaoo thats a good way to relieve it 
it be getting cold inside rn anyone else
whatchu mean homie i was never out of it
just when i thought I escaped the timer! lol
Yeah hopefully we can all get it! This project looks super promising! We are early!
hey if you ever need to talk theres a mentalhealth  dont beat urself up over it

Hey guys taking a break from cave 1

brookzion be sure to reply to messages or  them so it looks like actual engagements dont want you miss out
Hey Gorrie doing great. how about yourself?
Thanks guys! I cant keep up and keep replying to wrong ppl hah
Cave 2 is the chill zone with proper convo haha
Ill remember you brother we gonna make it
you dont got heat? or you saving bread like that lul
im talkin about beating my meat bro but good looking out lol i appreciate it
Yea how I wish x.x no work  eat grass
Good brother! about to make another coffee lol
What kind of meat you tenderizing? Im hilarious
yup thank God I mine eth in my living room cold temps are my friend lol
but seems if OS finds out abt a project offering passive income it can lead to bad endings!
Rem to put next mth salary into TIME haha
heat aint turned on yet it was 80 degrees last week
Sup fam!! Glad youre on the WL fam. Hows everything?
Lets make it together fam  MEEKARI its fine the devs never mentioned passive income the utility is actually for a game they are partnering with
facts i can see that youre new to cave 2 and youre loving it so far great to have you here 
Beny  awe i see now well dont beat your meat over it haha!!!!
TheWalrus057  i love a cold room  ima be honest i sleep naked in a cold room with a blanket and with a fan on haha i just love having the fan on
cold rooms are easier to sleep in
Haha and if the weather is not cold you have a sauna in your living room
anyone else just laying in bed typing hahah
bro I must start investing into eth mining! can DM me your specs and min cost to start?
Yeah new to the project bro havent seen a community this active with low members it is crazy. Organic
Yea no dev are gonna mention passive income..
Brother thr is no financial use of the token 
So I dnt think we have to worry abt it
yeah here is better i mean its one minute per XP given anyway so might as well chill here
nah im about to head to bed tho
Sup AP hope you were able to navigate through the server. WL is still available.
my shit be shrinking up in the cold deadass
Earlier I am haha Ive just woke up earlier hbu?
yeah Id be happy to tell you more about it
yup thats me rn laid back and just chilling
ThePunter  hell yeah organic growth is the best way for a community to grow im glad the project is taking this route
Sounds good brother  WE ALL GONNA MAKE IT !!
eth mining? is that legal now?? or ilegall?
yea thats what I thought too. Maybe those who outright says so will get into trouble. Thanks for clarifying
Yea I checked it out saw the WL options. Lot of grinders lol
Yeah and prefer to have a decent convo anyway!
ive just been on discord on my phone all day 
IamEvaa  Ryu ready to go to bed so the opposite !
Low mint count  pure wl  win win
already skaked more than i eat already X lol
whats everyone doing rn outside of discord
nice!! coffee is always good. where are you from?
bro it gets so crazy I have found if I dont watch it the temp increases slowly enough its like my body doesnt react to it I have to go outside to get fresh air my sweat response just doesnt get activated lmao
Yep will be so good love to see it
cant believe 5k 2days so organically thats insane to me
Its like a kaiju n cyber kongz !! 
yeah been here since the start 
yup dont treat it as a grind tho just keep active and engaging with the community and youll get there in no time
arceus  Cosmic Wyverns  yeah its insane for sure its only been 2 days and weve grown this fast sooner or later were gon be at 20k
I ve always wanted to start but I am bad at setting things up! Plus weather here is freaking hot 247365 in Malaysia. I ve prepared a cold room for it though lol
Just cooking some food for breakfast haha hbu?
Yeh its great no invite WL or anything beautiful community we got too everyone super nice
whats the coldest its been in malaysia
IamEvaa  Ryu just listening to music
yeap gotta grind for that WL. I believe there will be no public sale so all for Whitelisters only. good grind my man.
hahaha yessss.. this is awesome i love it too...
same same been here for almost 40 hours now but its been a blast
invite whitelists just get too overinflated IMO organic is the best way
Yup thats what Makes it fair and exclusive!
everything is good bro. more and more ppl are getting into the whitelist ! 
How are you guys having white list
Ooh what music are you listening to?
2426 if we get some cold breeze from north like from Bangkok. Or at the highlands 18
Nice!! Im from the States. California to be exact.
youre already ahead of the curve if you have a cool room to start mining in. Tbh cpu is not a great limiting factor you can get by on very low end processors the real investment comes in the form of GPUs but with ETH2 on the horizon its tricky determining when eth mining will cease. ROI concerns and all
whats up man how was the rest of your night w the homie who has the rs3?
you still gonna message this chat at slander right?
ayy nice always wanted to visit
yeah cant do it when i have to think of something random to type for XP
ya leaving me already nooooo we was suppose to go forever i already know when people say they going to bed they going to bed and hr later LOL
Is anyone trying to get on mint for Art Wars? the epic stormtrooper helmet art NFTs by different artist like damien hirst
Fellow Californian I didnt know that
lmao yea im just saying that now gonna go brush teeth
Awesome! yes WL count is growing. Cant wait to be a part of this community. Thanks fam!! Where are you from?

Lol meaning ur food budget per mth is lower than others
noo bro u cant go yet they gonna take ur job
Im cooking some eggs and some chicken breast 
epic you gonna have af un time too
Good to hear fam! Yeah the count is growing. Thanks fam!! Where are you from my man?
thats great for mining! we are averaging 3032 daily except if it rains by the buckets! Drizzle just makes its worse as it steams up the hot grounds up! humid af
yup def growing quick thousands of wl spots to go around still  were still in the  early stages of this project 
TheWalrus057 glad to hear that youre safe tornadoes are scary im from cali and i cant even imagine how those are
tummysalumi be sure to brush them teeth every day and night gotta keep em cavities to a 0
ill come bck in a couple hours and get it back no problem
Just chilling with the misso wby bro?
IamEvaa  Ryu man thats kinda delicious sad to say Im allergic to all of it
Eggs and chicken breast! Never heard of that combo for breakfast right?
U guys can have hobbies outside of nft? I barely have time to even sleep when nft in my life.
damn ok. thats what I like to hear.
Good morning everyone how are you doing ???
Tornados arent common here never see them haha
oh jeez! havent really done research on mining tbh but will def look into it. seems pretty sick
its 1240am right now. should be asleep but you know gotta love the grind and quality conversation in here. especially making new friends.
yup thats the attitude come back even stronger ill cya later
Seinic man honestly nfts take majority of my time i got buddies in college that had to drop a course cause nfts were literally taking up their life LOL
egg tart i wish you were here with me too
like pretty standard  3 meals per day nothing unusual lol
Theres something outside of NFTs?
yeah i find that hard tbh! but i try to take a break read  book or smthg
Same bro Im not having proper sleep recently all to nft! LFG
do it while eth is still POW cos once eth2 comes around its POS and mining work will be less lucrative! might be wrong but I think thats gonna happe
Im also just chilling having fun
doing good man!!! WE growing real fast
yeah when we have tornado activity during the day it doesnt bother me so much but at night you cant see the damn things
Yeah this is growing so good all organic too
its good to grind now here cos everything on OS is bricking no need to keep monitoring for good deals
Yessir!! You too? sweet!! Yeah no public sale makes this project pretty exclusive. Goodluck my man!!
yeah def going to have to look things up. very intriguing to me really. thank you for the info!
lmao be sure to get some good rest ik nfts are life but get good rest every once in awhile your body needs it!!!
same here bro last 1 month have been nft all the time! You remember how you got started?

visual swim wonder what does it taste like
its all you can eat! within a time limit
Wow thats like legit a day apart! Work tomorrow!?
Gogo try it xD I ordered the one with bacon n cheese haha
lol i went to japan and didnt get wagyu fml
I think you can make it at home easily
i aint have one of those in a minute i gotta try em again if i ever go to subway
arceus  Cosmic Wyverns wait no way thats real all you can eat that sounds insane LOL
In my case just a slight correction... For a year
PESInteresting  thanks for that will look into the monkeys!
hahaha if i can get at least 34 hrs of sleep I should be fine. Sweet im in Cali too. Sacramento to be exact. Good ish fam. We both should be sleeping. lol.
Im eating some chicken breast rn but I want some beef because of the picture haha
Haha yeah babykong looks awesome
TamagoEN also worth the try if you havent yet lol
i need to order some blue light glasses for nightslike these on discord  lol
ayo go get urself one i took my profits out of mutant cats when they hit 2.3e
yeah it was so good but wagyu is so filling...
Yeah sorry mate hahaha I made myself so hungry
everything is on sale now like black friday just that gas is so high and eth is so high so not even sure whats worth
Haha where ya from? I think eggslut is from US?
Yeah Im super hungry now thanks guys 
haha nice! might have to grab one soon its a good price
wagyu is good but there are as slightly cheaper alternative which are wagyu too but not from Japan
Man Im so sad I missed the mutant cats. I slept during that drop
yeh were pretty far apart. no i have the day off so ill be good. Are you still working right now?
which is ur favorite type of cookie from there?
Peter T. same coming from sac also wow great to see local people in here
arceus  Cosmic Wyverns  yup wagyu fills that stomach up quick now ik how they make so much money with that business lol  so much fat in wagyu is crazy but its so good lol 
Seinic  ooo i always wanted to try egg slut always see post it on stories
So what is the difference here and just the cave
whats your favorite cut of steak thats not waygu
Im from Oklahoma US I have not heard of that before but I love eggs lol
i mean wagyu is still expensive so
Is that the original? I heard only the original flavour is the mind blowing one
Choc chip bro so good. What about you?
a baby? nahh but have been thinking about it.
ser wagyu is not a cut but a cattle breed
KuroJPEG cheapest way to get in baby kong is breeding
Im sitting at work as we speak! Fortunately I have my own cabin space so Im sorted! Else it would have been a pain!
I have so many thoughts through my head lol might go subway now
I heard its overrated. Never tried it myself
Ah it seems like eggslut is from california
ive been to the eggslut in the US
im basic i like chocolate chip too lol  can never go wrong with OG flavors
arceus  Cosmic Wyverns  yeah wagyu is very expensive and we got people in here saying they just ate it ugh i wish i can say the same
Subways always a safe option! Cant go wrong!!
BAYC be eating better than wagyu!
Eggslut is not bad but a bit pricey in my option
so true you getting something to eat?
they are a go to I love their meatball sub cheap and effective
Gotta search it on YouTube on how to make that one. Really wonder how does it taste... Kind of corny flavour?
agreed i think its a bit overhyped
just buy bananas when they hit under 50 ull accumulate 600 in no time
Yeah have been thinking even get the VX too
Did u guys eat the original signature flavour or the others?
Yup! Just ordered something from the cafeteria! Gonna be here any minute
eating food straight from gordon ramsays kitchen but fr tho if you ever go hells kitchen its kinda overrated lol 
TheWalrus057  them meatball subs are always fulling and theyre cheap best combination
p sure we tried all of them like the classic the bacon egg and cheese as well
2 more legendaries in the VX pool u hit that u can sell at least 150eth minimum 850 left btw
I got the one with meat and bacon
Im eating cookie dough things be good
things are good but these folks keep making me hungry lolol
Cos i heard only the signature is mind blowing.. The rest are normal
4am here. think im going to call it a night. goodnight all! best of luck on WL
Wonder if I could put some butter and parsley on it
short rib and oyster blade is under appreciated  
awh man everytime i make cookies with my girl  i end up eating the cookie dough lol it sometimes be better than the actual cookie
IYKYK Clean  have a good one  was great to have you here for the day cya tmmr

BearX gave up thou! Too many ppl there! U!?

Im staying positive unless im in the rage chat
Lets get the wyverns.. Better art than bearx
nah sadly no its gon be completely random 
sup bitch  well well  would you look who it is
I still outside tho. Discord till phone left 15 batt haha..

Thanks everyone. I will make my time fruitful here! And engage the community.
im waiting patiently for those sick animations to come out i love animated nft art
projects that im in are CryptoDadsCryptoMoms Boonji Avarik and Eth Towers.
im sure we can yes. just mentally hurting me tbh. i know its not healthy but ive made it to this point already so its just wild
Furfam that flocks together GMI 
Gotta stay active and have a good chat. Where everyone from?
Yeh bro insane I love it too something about it just gets me so keen
Well big risk big reward brother!!! Lfg!!!
What one Roadmap excites u the most 
Zander just keep being active and engaging with the community itll evenetually come ur way
For tht we have to give our best !!
Cave 2 is the better cave right? 
Whats the hype bout eth tyres? Gotta check it out
nope at best they run on two feet hahahaha
the nft gaming aspect excited me the most  i really cant wait to see who the gaming partner will be
APE  Willhano you can say that lol its def more calmer in here than in cave 1
You can check your rank and follow Twitter btw
No i am indonesian  still afternoon here
One of the best going right now
Mmmmmmm how is that funny in any way ?
lets boost their twitter guys !!get it to 2k followers!
yeah love it its gonna do so well 861688761661652992
always a good sign when you see fellow furry ogs in here haha
IYKYK Clean  i agree the twitter following has so much more ppotential
Yea.. Games are the ultimate usecase according to me.. That was even visible for all those shit project who just used to mention games in their roadmap.. Now with FB in... Meta is gonna rule the world and games are gonna make us hooked in 
Yeah for sure you can already tell
Hahaha yes ofcourse  we all love genuine communities !! 
I think something about rewards in the future for holding a property. Dont remember too much. I know because they partner up with Cryptodads on a property.
but not both caves are created equal
i forgot about those facebook news its really gon be game changing cant wait to see what facebook has to offer
sup bitch  genuine communities are the best organically grow communities are top tier
Thoughts on snapshot being done over the weekend
i missed kaijus coz i was on a trip.. Still recovering from those... Keeping my eyes forward
All caves are created equal then 1 becomes
Gn everyone been chatting and having great conversations all day  aPESGiveLove
In this cave we all believe !!! Lets do this every one
Thanks buddy its just a fan art one  didnt get to cop it unfortunately.. hopefully i get these wyverns though!!
v1 yeah i jumped straight in when i saw that there werent any invite warz or anything  love communities like these
Good night fam!! Ill be behind you shortly.
Ah ok! I was looking at some sol projects but screw that! Im all in with this!!
but for me i dint think that facebook could be success catch people confidence on their wallet because they also have data leakage problem
Lots of flexing incoming..  Everyone gotta upgrade their systems to multiple monitors and high gpus... A more connected world.. 
Who wanna play riddles with me?
in the cave part of the cave lol
yup usually a good sign when communities dont req any types of invites
Rikimaaro  dont worry there are plenty of more nft drops to come 
unguardable RYU  awh yeah i forgot about their leakage issue damnit theres always something with facebook lol
lol. Yeah take a look at them. Good community there.
lucky we are here like not too late so have time to grind our way to WL fingers cross
just no more discord  hieroglyphics im all good
its almost 2022.. those should be gone by now !! 
Wyvern   Kaiju ..... I think they focus on different aspects... Can co exist well...    Kaiju is more Kongish and Wyverns are more Orcish ?
Mmm yes weve literally became part of the cave my friend!!! Hahaha
Yeah bone or a zinger tower meal with a a has brown
exactly they shouldnt even exist in the first place lol its a common practice that wont stop tho
i cant grind properly so many ppl here ?
Whats the difference with cave 1 and 2?
People in top rank 10 havent got WL yet. Is that correct?
True enough similarities and differences at the same time. The other names mentioned all belong on the moon...so.....see you there?
sup fam!! yeah this reminds me of the boonji whitelist. just community love and vibes.
Going to be insane man i love the price and collection size art so good this gonna make it and I hope we Are apart of it
Ppl shd start to use VR headsets more
yes man the most concern part of it because i had a conversation with my fren about purchasing something then facebook start to hardselling that product. i am like freaking shock about it
Will be so good man! super special!
Yeah i guess some projects need more advertising than others where as dope projects just let the projectart speak for themselves 
KuroJPEG Thank you buddy for your kind words 
oh this isnt too bad imo Space Apes activity grind was ridiculous lmao
mods not awake to WL people maybe
hmm havent thought about it yet but soon. maybe in 15 mins. haha
When green is definitely the question here!!
Anyone got in greens already just by being active? ..  I just came in yesterday.. but loving the vibes here... Helping with the gas high eth network boredom 
for me it really lost confidence on fb because they confirm selling our data information to the third party
Are we going anywhere at this point or were just grinding to nowhere
you can find the rankings here httpsmee6.xyzleaderboard902798623744618516
unguardable RYU  lmao facts facebook is always listening
sup bitch  100 the project art and road map should speak for itself

Sup buddy!! seeing many familiar faces here  great to be with you all here! BOONJI VIBES LESGOOOO

LEts gooo ....  unguardable RYU  u never go unnoticed... Lets get it ...   Subhra  True mate...
Hope we got enough time to get into this though ! did you just join recently ?
Neat!!! I like that energy from you xD no cave 3 no stop lol

Yeah fb already rules the world now he want to rule the metaverse. Such an ambition guy 
This chat room is gonna evolve into a new phrase soon at this rate
Yea.. v1  vibing in the right way.... Loving the insights as well...
we just gotta let things flow we cant control anything haha the nft market does as it pleases 
RYU namanam  facts zuckerberg tryna take over everything

Yea.. 5k already... 10k incoming soon... We all in here early.. Make use of it the irhgt way  ... v1  True.. Just be grateful we are early in the NFT space and flow with it.... If u are longterm bullish and have the conviction any looser plays of yours still would let u make it

I really love what I am seeing here the mods are really building a real community and not sot fake hype with invite contest
its like 5am but i dont really feel like sleepin tbh
no planned dates yet be sure to keep an eye on announcements  if they do announce anything
then we might need to sort out the  lol
Yeah I 100 believe organic growth projects is much more resilient towards market ups and downs and always have the longevity compare to those that fake the hype
thats the truth just a few left

Might have a break and get some dinner
I see u grinding hard have patience bro u will make it

Tintin nice to see you here long time no see 
Congrats for the og on this amazing project
It is so good you dont need anymore servers this one is way to active to leave
Hahaha you shouldnt feel the grind if your activity is meaningful !
Yeaahh! Really active here tho hahahaha
Love the feeling of this community too. SO glad to be apart of it
I was here yesterday same  time
what yall recommend for food i needa t hin kboutg breakfast
sir could you bring me into insight on how the mods are so motivated you guys really inspire us to work harder in life!
Wow you got mod in one day? Insane well done
Nice role man. You must have been early here
guys.... lets beat kaiju........ hope this one gonna bigger than kaiju
Yes brother really love the hype here 
yeah idk what this grind he is talking about 
I drop in cave 1 just now damn my eyes gone wild eyesflag
I kinda hoping that too lets goo.. beat someee kaiju lol we gonna make it brooo dont worry
Read faqs and announcements bro everything is there
isnt it. I love how organic it is. Has a different feel to other projects ive been in
It depends on the team and the community
make sure to drive safe to work 
If you love what you are doing you will surely enjoy it no matter whatyoull be dedicated and inspired
do you think we will succeed. i am concerned about the number of projects that have gone below their mint price recently
wow you are the OG whitelist. cool
Is art submission included also ? I dont see it there! Just submitted some more fan art
Yeah u need that.. i just eat my lunch.. time is exp hahahaha
They could make it top 200 in rank
I see huge potential in this project. The road map plus the small release of 3500 makes it so much more valuable than those of 10k plus 
this is a really good mindset! glad to see it in our mods and admin! really gives me even more hope for this project. visual swim  it looks like they have been giving green to random helpful people and people who do awesome fan art
community also have to involve...... no papperhand pls
Yes thats what I feel! They do so many different things here
indeed if you are passionate you never work a day in your life. congrats for being able to pursue your passions bro
i have a girlfriend a family friends and a job. and im also into crypto have to decide which way im going. 
i will call them all later and say goodbye 
Anyone have an addiction to this discord lol
like sub 200 lul. my buddy introduced me to this as my first project and Ive just been chattin away ion even know nfts like that
they already did make it top 200!
Yes and the future with this game is a stand out.
Time to guess whens the snapshot!
Yup I think we will. I have confident!
I think they already made is top 200 mate
indeed many of the other projects have been so greedy with increasing the supply above 10k this here we have a unique gem!
keeps me busy here while i wait to tire out and knock out got halloween stuff to go to later at night and next day
But its not automatically right? They are selecting members that are under top 200 rank so doesnt mean you will get WL just for being under top 200 in rank GNaga  WYVERN 
Welcome in this space my frnd  
Its really a nice project to get start in this nft space !! 
So what do u think abt this project bro ?
Still havent rain in my place maybe in the night rain because the smell of rain already come out
Love to see it! I believe in this team
you can get WL by being nice and engaging in chat 
Dont lose hope guys remember if you work hard it will pay off soon. So this project will surely be worth it cause we are working on it. What we are building is not just a community but also a family love you guys
active top 200 will get it at a random snapshot  they are actively whitelisting people.
Yup agreed! We keeping our supply in check and making sure only those interested holders will get in to the project
with the amount of work the team is putting in everyday i am sure believe they deserve a much higher mint price!
Just wait my man. Good things come to those who wait
Just the art itself has me buzzing
Isnt this more of due to high gas and eth prices.
yeah i mess with the pixel art and the blue eyes ode
Thats is good so Ill be in top 200. Thats easy actually I thought they were random selecting the ones on top 200
You do get selected but you need to have quality convos
When is the result is gonna announce for the top 200 members ?
Happiness is what matters. whitelist is just secondary.
Yeah something about it has me hooked haha
Not sure if eveyone in 200 will get WL tbh. Seems like mod handpicking
not losing hope at all! if i dont get it before the weekend i will come back monday and try again  hope i am not passed up to much! thank yall for being awesome mods. Have had only good experiences here so far. ryu  kaysainz  yes sir at a random time they will take a snapshot. Farinasaur  yes sir just keep staying active and helpful
They didnt announce. As long as u contribute they will notice sometying like that
We have 3500 to be whitelisted. Just dont bother at all
finna snapshot while you at 201
Never compromise not even in the face of Armageddon
Yup the team here is amazing. Excited to see where this would bring us!
Ah isee broo now its timee to get ourrr changee lets gooo.. have you eat yet?
love you too. this is one big family and we will build it together
its good to be here. hanging out in the server. how about you?
Man we are so early! get this white list before the hype gets to much
I really want the give wl to the quality not to the quantity
same! just grinding my levels D
Gonna eat my dinner. U guys have fun!
Cmon rare pepe is happy rich. Dont cry. Lol
well a decent amount of the top 200 are modsadminalready green listed so big chance id still get it 
im just tryna see the next activities already
Better do a meme a GIF or something ASAP so they can note me lmao
hope can get wl soon bro..... this project will be huge.....we can beat kaiju
Tintin Hey tintin would you guys be releasing the breath contract for the community code junkies  to help review please?
Lets goo we can make this community stronger
Yo fugazi.. u still yooing until now didnt feel tired?
we can coexist with kaiju maybe even collab  dont need to beat them. Plenty of money in nft to both be a great floorproject!
Indeed broo lets goo to the moon
Have a good dinner. Im feeling pretty hungry too
aye lmao welcome back havent seen you in a minute im still here
I just eat my lunch bahahaha no time for eat.. i think its already raining in here
I have butterflies after reading through the project might actually be early enough for a good one!
Jst keep motivated brother we can get this
Out of all the caves which is your fave ?
anyone wear night contacts here
Fugazzi na not tired yet waiting to get tired and go knock out
fr being happy is important than everything
yeah plenty of spots to go around man! dont worry
You dont need eat lunch broo. What you need is eat some rank lol
but being on the whitelist makes me so much happier haha
Its a good one mods and community seem solid too
I have school but no classes friday
Question will they close this discord after 3500 being whitelisted?
M chatting in both bro n I think we need 1 more chat room 
guys if youre sleepy or tired heres a tip imagine yourself grinding off and finally getting rewarded with a mint. and you will have finally earned some well deserve sleep this never fails to hype me up
Yeah first thing I noticed man so good to see
LoL. Is chatting in both gives you more xp?. I think not. Its based one per minute. I guess
I think not. The large community is a testament to the success of the project
Yeah team is important. Do not wanna be in a rug project
Sometimes you cant sleep thinking the art you minted and cant wait for reveal. So no sleep at all lol
haha smiling everyday if you get that haha but dont give up youll eventually get it 
Feeling good about this giveaway lol
Yeah hahahahha at the first time i think i can get it before eat then until now didnt make it so better i eat first before pingsan

Oh cool. Then the job gets easier when you got friends around

Wow finally lvl 5 lol seems like still long way to GO
from malaysia buddy where are you from? 
Feels like this is a good inbetween before Eth 2
Rage is the one place to be . With less waiting.
Tintin id like to report someone botting in the other channel as soon as he saw my accusation he deleted messages i think but his older history is also similar to his current and only after accusing him is he now being normal did he delete messages? a log check might be needed
Edit i just realized i cant  him so idk how to tell you who it is lol
how do you guys get the raffle elligble role?
Gotta work my way to whitelist.
Just woke up and saw the legendary animated wyvern that shit goes hard!

Enjoying a coffee to star well the day
Wait for your Raffle Eligible  role guys read at announcements

Yeah we will never know i guess. Thats why its a conspiracy theory xD
Shan dont worry buddy getting to lvl 2 is not that hard  and i dont think the next giveaway will be anytime soon.. but not too sure though gotta be on the look out! 
Puma nice buddy i have a place in puchong but rn with covid its hard to move around. Hows the cases there now ?

Ahahahah i thnk i need some boba tea but its so expensise can u buy it for me?
Everyone here loves their coffee hahaha
things moving really fast in the cave think ill just chill in here
dont have an idea honestly lol life of an NFT addict
coffee is super addicting to me ! do u drink black coffee or w. milkcream?
Oh no I have no clue how to do that lol Methodson just gotta rely on raffles
Tintin could you assist me with a botter ? really annoying that hes top 200 and botting unfair on the real grinders
Gotta love it it is an essential in this world
bobaaa tea which one do you want? a tiger suger? or a whatt elsee i forget lol.. btw .. you so good with rank noww i envy broo lol

OMG VAANSH you got WL ! well done bro! dm me ill tell you
In da houseee aawyeah  whole squad here!
I just missed out on OG role. Saddd been here since 500
Damn all the chats are moving so fast
No red yet bot is broken poor bot
allows you to enter giveaways D
mad whats his id though let me keep an eye on him as well
exactly. those are only beneficial to those who use bots and have no interest in the project. what they care about is getting as much wl as possible to profit from it. Not beneficial for any project
for sure bubble tea can be pretty expensive 5 per one
hahaha yess boba buble milk tea will save yourrr dayss if the climate so hot
will do! i hope i also get picked here
no worries buddy gotta keep an eye out for one another 
I am now at 270 rank I also want 100 rank
I am doing okay. Just trying to see whats up with this project
i think the invites are actually detrimental because people create spoof accounts
Yess the bot does too much work haha
spazzin notice how he only started replying to people when i accused him xD
The thrust gang becoming world wide hahaha
imagine paper handing the next blue chip
ooo I love drinking it during the winter too do u have any specific brands  u like to drink from?
WAGMI boys even if we all dont get the WL
Let us pray we make it before the snapshot! Either way it will be fun to chat
Yeah i guess we just gotta look at it like were talking to close friends ! makes it much easier tbh slightsmile doesnt even feel like a grind
and create an empty and toxic community
giveaways chat activity memesfan art are some of the ways
Its an amazing project! The community is the best and the team is amazing! Check sneakpeek
Yeah if you rely on invites and chat spam for WL you end up with 40k on discord but dont sellout Mint
Haha people do it man there always paperhands and flippers looking for a quick buck
whose the highest rank i wonder
Taking all the right steps to make sure it is successful
ikr so sad but i dont think the mods are seeing it 
after the quickflips were mooning
fax no substance to most of the discords that do that
nahh for mee all boba milk tea is good  and taste i only like original milk tea hahhah
This or Ur project sellin out to flippers and then floor crashing haha
Any wyverns here from Melbourne still sitting in the dark?
Where are you from? Did you stay up all morning?
It must top 20 thats the save point bro until this rank it nvr bern save hahaha order me chatime broo
yes right you said we have to do this lets do both together you help me im yours
What is diff between cave and cave2?
Even before that we moon ww just sweep our way to the moon 
Farinasaur haha cant blame him he been at ut for quite a long time needs a break
make sure you eat and drink everyone health above grind haha
Of course but we broke the bot 
Just to split it out really though. 1 chat would be hectic
Yes it just a cup of tea with pearl better drink mineral water
oooo do u adjust ur sugar levels ? I love OG milk tea too esp. from the bakeries
Just another place to interact with people. Less volume so its easier to have conversations. But chillcave  is where its at
i gotta eat soon im waiting a lil tho for traffic to die down
No diff buddy theyre many members so it makes it easier for everyone to talk to one another 
Coach Greg nah bro thats not a conspiracy.. thats a delusion lul

nice nice so r u on break at werk rn or multitaskingg
not many kids come by my house im in a rural area
Hahaha kidding I suck lol but would be fun af
Cave one moves to fast makes my head hurt haha
So real conversation over grinding . Do I hear it correct?
Yess i can see myself enjoying something like that when i was smaller 
Mannn you making me want burger rn like fr lmao
So the manual picking of whitelist members are separate from the top 200? 
Shout out to the mods ! Great theres no invite competition either
Heck ya nice to see you thoughty
yomsssssssssssssssssssss its the morning and i usually just chill but i should start working or else imma look like a bozo
Damnnnn man this looks sooo good
lmao bro why you eat the same burger as yesterday also forgot to mention but your mouth must be hella expandable

Welcome to the best community! Check announcements and sneakpeek
PeepoGiggle breh this COMMENT LOLLKEKWaddle
big ass burger or smol ass handssomethings gotta give hahaha
Good luck buddy. Just focus on building this community too and share it with your mates
thank you! I hope you have a wonderful dayevening as well
Haha. But would be fun to see others doing it
hi my name is vo whats your name
haha yeah did a 23 day bender on squid game was hooked lmao .  yep alice in borderland was great I think it got a lil outlandish towards the end but thats just me lol. first 6ish episodes were great
Wow! So many green IDs now! So nice to see and would be so nice to have it too and soon I hope! Hahahaahh all the best everyone
what does everyone watch squid game for?? im not someone who watches tv shows often. is it worth the time
Yeah I would have a good laugh hahaha
Lmaoo it can fit in the the mouth tho
Yes we are watching over the members that are always helpful to the community
suggesting sushiramenphotacosburger
Good morning to you and evening to me
what the difference from this and thecave
So can I ask the reason for having two cave channels? 
Invite competitions are unfair too and they just keep on inviting bot
promotes a super healthy community 
Turn me on turn me on baby turn me on turn me on
Do you want me to tell you interesting things that I know? Im curious about everyone
I can sing schwifty . From Rick and Morty. 
Dont you want choives? Haha lol
hal Id say its certainly worth the time the overall concept of the show and inescapable debt leading to people acting out of character and doing anything to survive was cool. defo give it a watch if you can
True and also uninterested people that joined 4 join
No WL for the one who saved the world 
Just 22 usd here in ph  this is fire! Ive tasted this lol
Personally don like invite competition
You guys really making me drool
Yeah tbh these invite warz just make the community less genuine. When you get invite warz you invite bots spammers and people who just AFK in the server. Theres 5k people in this discord and only 1.7k online but all chats are vibin. its great what you all have built here my guy  im happy to be a part of it!
I think at this rate we need more channels. Just thinking of a page for those on discord while they are at work. Shows some real dedication for this projsct
He will get it soon he just needs to be patient
Sure . Go ahead. I am all ears.
Two different chat to control volume!  5000 people commenting at once can be quite overwhelming as seen yesterday  we may need cave 3 soon if we keep growing!
Omg thats the biggest burger Ive ever seen lmao
imagine finding 10 friends who know what nfts are gdi
looks good is it 22usd? is that cheap?
yes join uss broooo to the twiiter make it hypeee
Hey guys talk to me why are you leaving me?
jeeez yeah thats crazy even with slowmode
So true. I dont fancy troubling others much. Some may not like being asked to do such.
I just hit level 8! climbing slowly but surely
you guys did such a good job catching bots creating real organic growth and not to mention an amazing project! so glad to be a part of it  
I dont even know a single person that knows anything about NFTs!
Yes for sure so thats why we secided not to have invite competitions for a fair and healthy community
Yes Sir it is hard for some players to get invites.
Yeahhh its cheap in USD but kindey pricey when in philippine peso
yeah did u join the giveaway ? there is so many update in there
I agree with you on that completely
FR! Love every single member here
1700 online but that number is not with the members that appear offline on discord i think so maybe around 2500 online
chillcave is fire if you want to just relax. Chat is much much slower
is there any sort of cultural influence on the show or the plot from it being based in ?
hahaha yeah its hard tbh  but thats why you find genuine communities and build your network from there. dont start with a community that has invite warz or itll never be genuine. Start with a strong solid community and meet genuine people from there. thats how this NFT space works at the end of the day  good connectionss
i already feel healthier being in here hehehehe
Yup people are super passionate here. Hope you will enjoy your time here! 
Keep climbing bud youll get there
Im Vietnamese where I have a pretty good dish pho you know it
this project is rapidly GROWINGGG oii
yes of courseee all join broooo.. mee never late for anything lol
How do u actually pronounce pho btw.
Thank you We appreciate all of you thanks for the support
Hoping doesnt get too quick lol

No worries buddy glad to be a part of this community and cant wait to see where this project takes us !!
I LOVE PHOOO!! Its perfect for the colder days PeepoHeart

keep going bois! its worth the grind  cant  all of you im going to get some lunch!
i love this community And I want to be in this community forever
ive never had it whats it taste like?
Thank you for the dedication sir especially to the team of this project
Yes bro! Try to go here in ph where there is good food!
Seems like cave 2 is mostly dedicated to food talk still 
this is a nice and supportive community. I like it
That is the spirit we need! LFG
Same here bro. If this is what we can achieve in 2 days give us 2 months and we are going places!
This is the best approach to have because paper hands and people looking for a small flip are not healthy for projects because they cause the floor price to tank and encourages FUD. Ofcourse if a project is good at core itll flourish but those people cause some damage which can and should be avoided.
wtf so fast already 86 im maybe 70 better keep going so not catch up with u hahahahaha
yep still wanna visit got some axie scholars that are from PH genuinly nice people
yeaah Id say so primarily derived from the location and general lifestyle of the Korean people. Its only really emphasised in the the scenes where theyre laying background info and character development. It doesnt really creep in during all the action scenes etc. though there are cultural references in several of the games
yes a diamonds handss really good really... thats make project keeps alive..
Were glad that you are enjoying and excited
We are also interested. But what to do this is my first project is
Yeah im sure before launch wed see numbers close to 80k 
pho reads as pho I dont even know how to explain it. You can go to Vietnam I will take you to eat it and show you how to pronounce ok
same as you! did you just join here?
looking at the chat we all are mate
Its really good. Ive read up some and besides diamonds are a girls best friend. 
Yes so no to invite competitions 
Yup! Good move from the team. Quality  quantity. We need people who puts in the effort and have a stake in this project no paper hands!
What other Vietnam food famous for tourist to try?
Im sorry man I was asleep for the last 10h  please dm me the bot
Ohhh axie here is very popular! Helps lot of my friends to get income 
its where the hungry people go.
CamzRC understandable. i have the day off today so maybe ill just watch it in the background or something. ive been hearing a lot about it but your description leads me to believe its worth watching
hahaha  really broo you already at 64 brooo.. dont mocking me... 
Organic is the best way that way people wont shane project also alwaya have a loving communitue
u havee to try it for urselfff there are diff brothss drool
yep its really good like they get a good salary from axie alone
See us work just wanna see you work. LFG
well I feel like thats mission accomplished on my part aha I hope you do enjoy it!
We hitting 10k by the end of the week fosho
So beautiful. have you been to Vietnam yet
yes mr palindrome we flying to the cosmic zone here
Yeah I think we are still early  excited to see what we can do to help grow this space!
I also want to come in 64 dont know know when this will happen when can i come
ah really i tought it 70 hahahaha lets keep up broo
that would be a pretty amazing gain
i hope the drop doesnt take that long though im already anticipating the drop now p
Hi welcome to the best community! How are you?
You pronounce pho as fur and in a very gentle tone. Ive been to and NaThrang is pronounced as NaChang?
Imma say the moon but more likely pluto rainbowhappy
Axie Infinity gives more opportunities to those who lost their jobs senior citizens for their medicinesmaintenance and especially for working students.
yes i do 5050 slp just fair but some get 50 who get higher slp than some scholars
yess keep up the paceee. hurry up need top 50 and take a rest a bit then grind again till top 20
There is pho and bread you eat you will be addicted its different from other countries bro
Hey bro. Working hard as usual I see
a couple of giveaways i would say 
around 270 here will hopefully join ya in the promised lands haha
yeah dont give up now its too early just stay poisitve vibes my friend we all achieve it
There will be 3000 WL spots for real?
Yes very well said quality over quantity
I think itll be the 2nd or 3rd week of November stated in the announcements but ofcourse it may be subject to change  i cant wait for it too!! its gnna be so dang hype
STEYSTRONGGG im not giving up eitherr oii
Woah u great my friend! I know someone whos really greedy make the slp split 8020 lool such an ass
Damn what level to get there man?
I believe its a 100 WL so however many wyverns are available thats the WL spot!
Dont give up u will get it Dance    
RYU  IWAN yess way too early mate 
the moon is like the closest thing to us. Why stop there? I say we see was Uranus has in store for us
good! just had chicken and ramen for dinner! anything up with you?
Yes there are so enough time to get one
no where is Vietnamese pho it will sound different and it will taste so much better because it is made through a very complicated process
I have tried Pho here in my country but i think its not authentic and that food which looks like spring rolls.
Hopefully I am here for the next one thanks!
Thats awesome give me more hope
oh interesting i didnt even see that!!! i wonder if all of the 3k whitelist spots will fill up before then. were going to the moon.
We love each other care for each other help each other 
yeah me too dong give up stay strong babyy
impressive work man. Love your goal and determination
Yes as this is only a presale mint and theyll be only 3500 wyverns. 500 are given to OGs Early birds 2950 are given to whitelist members active helpful top 200 or those manually selected by the mods for theyre helpfulness or fanart or meme submissions and the last 50 for collabs and partnerships 
I think we will have a chance! The community is super engaged here! Hope we will all get the chance!
Ye not even worth to do that imo its like shit man doing that
just imagine once we get that youtube video exposure. man scratch that we dont need that. we have organic word of mouth
Need a parmy friggin starving out here
its different from spring rolls. its almost like a pot of tea but its made of different essences
thank you  always here for ya as well just so you know
I just cannot wait to get into the list! And i sure everyone is too!
Need to eat something ! What is your favorite plate ?
im also gonna take a bath and eat dinner
Those wyverns are so beautiful cant stop staring them

Dont give up way too early mate 
CamzRC thats kind of u sir thank you 
Go for it brother. I am at work so cant get out . Haha
Hahah when YT shout out projects sometimes you would get the paper hands and real early flippers looking for a small profit so they arent the best to have around really.
All nighters are life at this point lol
We all arre family in this community
Yes i have been there and its amazing. I like sappa a lot
pho wont rug you like flur will

hahaha yes mate i was resting awhile ago lying in bed. now i have recharged and want to continue.
What pizza do you get from dominos
peepoGiggle big facktss doughh PRIORITIES  WYVERNSS
Nope. I had to whittle it down by doing 4hoursx2 and eventually the times I slept were at night luckily
Tag a mod with the name of the bot or raise a ticket
What are people going to dress up as for halloween
Now its still working as usual because the epidemic has been overcome
it does help! i would say it isnt 100 a knockout you do have to consciously set your mobile phone aside for it to be effective  kinda require discipline as well
I want some to i recently order kebab shoarma pizza
Still working here altho its already 10pm
Damn how was it? never tried it
Bro I didnt even realise your name. Coach Greg is goated  
wow juyst seeen the animated sneak peak its nice af
good question definitely nothing squid game related as that will be 60 of what Ill see lmao
never sleeep bro now its our life in the cave
I am Vietnamese I am very proud of that. why do you look so racist
yea honestly i think thats the biggest thing i fail with... leaving my phone before trying to go to sleep. even just being in front of screens all night just messes with sleep too
Halloween really isnt that big in the East here.  So we never really celebrate it.
i m not racist bro just appreciate ya know
Damn I really am pumped up for this project tunes gor me dancing around at midnight haha
ooo ik some people that do celebrate Halloween
Will react a bit later on pm hehe
CamzRC I already saw squid games costume
Muiz I feel you I dont dress up like that for halloween like that ever
Hahaha i guess so! But remember to stay hydrated mate
i wanna try Tom Rin Don looks delicious
yuh im from SG unfortunately im doing well cant wait for the borders to reopen VN is first up on my bucket list 
staff ive got a bot ive found you mind shooting me a dm regarding it?
lol be wise use the right words next time 
fair enough lol. have a coffee then or some tea with caffeine
Haha. We all kinda do it . But dont say it.
Hi bro im from malaysia. We are neighbours
This giving me kaijukings vibes I missed out on that coz I was stupid but Im not missing out on this gem
Hahaha dont dance too much and make the neighbors think ur getting controled by a demon lol
Just be it. I think some of you here is a ghoster hahahahaha! just kidding
Halloween is pretty big in the west! Europe and NA but its not that hyped in Asia and especially the South East Asian countries. 
If youre not comfortable mentioning the username of bot here you can send it to me via DM.
just ignore that. where are you from france or america?
We all gotta do what we gotta do! XD
id like to agree...i also missed out on kaiju but regardless of whitelist or not i would love to get my hands on one of these. art is soooo nice
Its good if there is garlic sauce on it hahaha
what we eating for lunch thoooooo
Can we get a W train for this W of a project and community ?
Wow i got wl talking about demons pepelmfao aawyeah aawyeah
I think people are gonna dress up as bots lay the ban hammer on em
You are absolutely right bro. Keep vibing for it.
Bro I saw the animation while scrolling through twitter and I was hooked. Looks amazing
Hopefully mate im really tired ill wake up early tomorrow gonna go to the public market.
I think they are already freaked out lol fat man shuffling and shit
What is it Ive never heard of it

congrats bro! heard lee zi jia beat him in the london opens 
I think more or less the same bro
What the different bw cave 1 and 2 ?
Good stuff brother! deserved it
I think just two different channel to spread the load? I could be wrong though. Yesterday was crazy with one chat  things were moving so quickly!
Hahah where do you live? Are you in the west? Because I know halloween is huge there!
100. Im hella new to the space so Ive taken like 4 Ls in a row which kinda got me down for a bit. But I realised that I can easily turn that around with one good project
I can recieve DM though ill check on it
Ohh diff people for sure and good conv haha its goin a bit slower
you might be onto something there POGSPIN  also nice username 
if you have ideas please feel free to share them in suggestions
Yea man. Dont worry about it . One good. Project and you will be good

Not much chilling with the best community!
Muiz thank you sir   will be waiting for u with a drink
Oh wow I dropped down to rank 47 
In Vietnam there will be another version of that dish
Mums food is always special. I cant find it anywhere else lol.
rank 47? Or the top 47? Insane either way!!!!
Neither do I! But this ones worth a shot fr sure!
Haha how did you even find this project early dude? 
Not a ton because I just dont have the time to make a loaf but I feed the starter every week to keep it alive. Ive probably made about 2 dozen or so loaves from it so far
Wish i learnt about nfr or crypto while at school. Im now working and this is more promising that my current job! Going into this 100
Im going from cave to cave and somehow is lost trying to reply someone! Thats not so nice of me
People going hard I lost 36 spots over night on my way to recover them
Honestly I wish I had the skill to cook amazing food
I wish I knew how to find projects early lol
Got a alpha group  and that whole group here so i hoped in aawyeah aawyeah

Its never too late! Im here at this age of mine and Im enjoying every bit of it. Its kind of tough juggling but hey! We make our own time!
Hahah can I ask which alpha group? Like is it attached to a certain project or just some people joined together?
Is it a public alpha group? If so drop link in dms? 
I lost that much too it sucks but we are about to gain 100 by today anyways so its not a bad tradeoff
its dropin from the moon to the earth
I need to work out my twitter haha

Yeh curious about that too. Also any tips you could share with us? 
Nice pfp bunni for life got some but hodling
Lets go for it irrespective of what the outcome maybe!!
Not quite  I know some of the people at the very top and they wouldnt give up their spot that easily 
man bots are going to ruin small artists
It gets much harder the higher you get lol
to discuss food no other reason
What kind of bots are you talking about if I may ask?
 cheers gang feeling warm here 
Yep hodling too! I bought super high so I cant sell haha  wish I bought cheaper bc I love the art but it is what it is
I cant say that sorry. We all from different project i joined them because bearx 
King Kro yess sir we get fast info haha. Sorry cant do that only boss can invite  really sorry

Haha i know all good im happy to share what i can  
King Kro yea its a small packbut we thight
nice lions u got there whats their floor rn?
Yes very fast and good hype team
Exactly you never know and NFTs are in such a bear market rn. The next bull run will be great
ones that snipe a unknown collection because its making traction it makes it difficult for an actual collector to buy in a a reasonable price and then go elsewhere when the owner of the bot was just looking for a flip
Honestly the only actual difference was that gifs work here lol
what do you guys think about phantom going to ios??
you created the vip cave I like this cave the best haha
Sounds 1010. Hook me up if you ever get the chance 
A nice friend I made in another server shared the invite for this with me today! And despite the members and activity I still feel like I got in early.

Yup indeed! We are all still early!
What about the Whitelist chat?  keep going

Muiz thats kind of him. Yea ur earlier than the other 5k that will come 
I can see the project go 10k end of the week
Yup indeed! I think we will hit 6000 members in the next few hours!
Dont have that as a goal man. Just engage genuinely and have fun in the server and sooner or later you will definitely get selected!
I didnt know we had that chat. This is still the vip cave even if I get whitelisted LMFAO
You are learning English? Much needed in this space for sure bro good luck
because I just broke up and got scolded by my mom
Yep so we may wait for the big boost nft
i agree 6k incomming very shortly 
mannnnn so saddd we can be friend ya know
yes I am looking for an English teacher. would you like to teach me lol
Bear market is the best time to accumulate the good ones. Once the money flows back in we will be flying to the moon. So diamond hands only!
Ah maybe you can learn from interacting in here. Feel free to ask me any questions or for any explanations
Yes Easy in few hours we are 6k
What are you doing or are you just staying at home?
were gonna reach 5500 members later. Please follow officiallinks Twitter account too. spread it to your friends guys
Haha I dont think Im qualified for that not my main tongue as well
I actually think it can easily be 20000 in like 79 days there is so much great potential here.
Same wyvern should be in the bluechips
back. did I miss anything important
apeshit treasure chest being dropped tmoro
Dudeee the animated Wyverns look amazing this will be big
Fugazzi omg sorry haha I was at like 22 last night!
Yes. America and Europe is only waking up now arent they?
If 1 yt talkes about us we go boom
I really love how active this community is lots of kind people also
All channels are great cause all members are great too
I love animated ones. Such a sucker for them
this is definately one sure fire way to keep bots out
just vibing with the wyverns !! oii
Yup! It will only grow bigger and bigger from here!
word bro ive been stacking up some names while everyone in the chat were turning negative buy when cheap  sell when pump. think and act like smart money
Cant believe this has only been out for 2 days
Hahah I honestly dont want YTs to talk about us just yet because it might attract the wrong crowd! I would rather we invite our close people and friends that we know are diamond hands and will hold!
We always are everyone is ready for wyvern haha
What blue chips you guys buying while market is down?
Yes. I feel theyre a huge part of the population!
I know the feeling! Im WL in another and keep going back everyday to jus stay hi to the others. Many would have just stayed quiet and worked elsewhere for another. The saying home is where the heart is seems to be in okay here
big facks dough energy here is STRONKKK oii
Yup! When people zig we zag! We need to be different to win!
Honestly think its bound to happen
It can go both ways with yt especially after so many project got disc hacked
best Ive seen yet in any project
OMG same! They will be expensiveee though haha
no FUD either that is refreshing  nothing i was just commenting on the system and the how the WL is being done
YT videos arent the best for most projects that is just my judgement. Haha.
hi there welcome to cosmic wyverns brah. howd you land here buddy
Q1010 oh amazing hardest language in the world lol
more if we keep the hype like this. they have to do well on their socials too
For me it depents on the youtuber some can bring massive fomo into projects
Yeah with the traction we are getting likely only a matter of time before someone talks about us!

Isnt it! Its a bit of a fresh air. Cave 1 is going so quick I cant even reply to convos.
Man just got a good massage. Its rejuvenating
Yeah.  We just chill in discords and have fun here for most of the day! But this is one job that we can do from anywhere in the world so we do have that luxury
yep wish i had gotten two but you know what they say about hind site
Right!? Some of the others lately have not felt very genuine the way pushing invites
I am from Philippines. Where are you from ?
Im in my office and I can here the PE teachers in the gym playing Somebodys watching me

Haha. I can understand. If you had 2 you would have wished for more. It never ends

Yup! The fact that this project has grown so much in just a few days organically without any sort of invites competition etc just shows how good this i!
The blood bath nft market now haha meme hype is on again
Hope I can get one is there any info out?
Honestly the same that I told you!  Just chilling in here having fun with all of you.

Im excited that its Friday!!! And  I will still be getting my 5 to 6 hours of sleep every night 
Haha. I know. Thats brings us many buying opportunity as well. But I stand at level ground with you. Zero liquidity. Haha
phor shore cave 1 is preddy populated my eyebaws kent ketchup sumtimes

You bet. I will take a long leave from the office if I have to. LoL

same here. not a problem though. ive got all day.
now i am on level 10 240 rank is mine Im on 200 now merko aaj hi 100 rank main ana
Ofc love the art and the project sounds fascinating. Also the community is solid and mods are keeping it very clean and are very attentive. Super organic project feels it is going places.
Haha I dont think you are that dumb. If you into nft you are already smart I assume. Haha
for sure slower messages but a minute slowmode is a killer
Daily reminder to drink water!!!
Thanks.. Im just having a bit of a look around atm.. I enjoy this stage of a new project
i started this yesterday so now im too close to it I am going to come on rank 200 in a while
Nice broo!! keepp the grind goinggBDOPE
good bro. Keen for the project. How about yourself?
Smart you which one are you aiming? All these virtual world metaverse projects are nuking MANA and SAND are doing so good
Needed tho to stop spamming and keep convos
hey guys whenever you see an influencer posting something we can raid just dm me the link of their tweet 
Definitely and I dont know haha im here if you got any more doubts
Heard about this from a pal and the moment I am in you can just see the comments going in people interacting with each other. You dont see this often really in other projects. Everyone is positive and friendly with few bots or people FUDing. Really impressed by what the team has been doingmanaged to achieve!
haha I have to work and my job keeps getting in the way of important grinding
looks like a tough grind ahead but for the art  worth it
np do some research i suggest it would be worth your time if you have not already
slower messages? not by much though
 Ive been hooked on since I joined as well! Its a good vibe
cool I just saw announcement seems like I still got chacne !
MANA and SAND just pumped because of facebook changing their names to Meta. . and I hit the fookin lottery today with FLOKIG i put in 1k yesterday
Yeah I will need to when I get some time
damn boring life is a happy life hahahhaa
Yeah that sounds great..  Oh yeah the animated version of the Wyvern Master is on fire.. Nice colours too hey
no to follow any info so I dont miss anything
Yeah you really cant find this elsewhere and I myself is involved in a few projects!
phor shore we are being given meni opportunities ! PeepoHeart
I got it.thanks for your help.You are so kind .
Just chillin out chatting with wyverns
Yeah I believe active still got chance !
Me too! I literally havent looked at any other project after finding this
anybody high on any other NFT projects at the moment?
well im dumb enough to put most of my capital into nfts need to be more liquid. lesson learned
Did you see the other tease in road map? Whats going on there!?
this is THE place to be on discord

i luv ramennn esp. on the colder dazeee
Yes that is manageable  will you drink ? Hey sup bitch you good ??
Yes its a little chilly today so Im hyped 
Nah bro. As more people chat itll be a higher ranking. Level 11 wont guarantee a top 200 spot
the cave 2 will still be the home for food discussion
Okay keep going mate this project will be to the moon soon just stay here
food if you look the very top of the channel your mouth will start watering 100
Youre good matee these meme hypes are going nutss haha took your profit yes?
Nice. Yes seems like there are quite a few actual conversations going on rather than just frantic typing. Artwork looks super nice.. thought Id start with the Sneak peeks..
Nah man. You get to learn from every step you take . Wont call it dumb. I am infact in the same state as yours.
Hahah its not that boring though! It has its upsides.
u ever had pho? those r guud to for colder daze
idt MANA and SAND are meme coins. theyre P2E and will definitely blow up in 12 years
Hey ! wow u have green name here
will I? hell yeah! Ill likely be on a rum  coke vibe I think
Yall were making me hungry haha 
Nope because it isnt a set figure. You can see your current stats in botcommands  with !rank though

Yes people here are engaging with each other
hieee LeafFlower!! WELCOMEEE to the WYVERNS zone party nice 2 meet u

But the NFT space itself is very exciting. Learning about them and when you see your project rise and associate with experienced people its a new unique feeling for me.
Is there any themetopic the art should meet? Or just a wyvern somehow diffrent?
haha youll get it back in no time. Ive been here all day only mid 100s.

Remember to check out giveaways if you just got in!
well this is definitely one of the more promising projects out there
Haha so many people are going for it
hey hey welcome man! im new as well
Particularly on a project that people are super excited about.. No public mint eh  I like that  Gas fees have been crazy just recently
I need to see this do you have a link?

exactly! this is real hype you can tell its organic and people really wan tthis
Is anyone here grinding while theyre at work ? Risking it all for the Wyvern haha

Organic growth is going to be really nice for activity in the long run
Yes. I love it. These moderators have to be my favourites Ive came across in any project. I love how interactve they are and they do so good for the community. I love it
Hmm i might check those out!! how did u find out about this or furball?  i think minting bearx will still be good but i dont think itll be as good because of the incident
Okay.. yeah it sounds like the developers here are thinking things though pretty well.. Dont get pigeon holed eh
Because i love my cave 2 friends!
Sorry dumb question what the different between cave 1  cave 2? Lol
thanks bro  good luck to you too!!
Doing great just waiting for the results of the giveaway
We all got a chance if we participate!  and I think there will be 3 winners this time round!
Literally staff is the reason this project is so loved. Great communication and they listen very well
So I found about Turtle Shells through a friend in Furballs! They have the same mod team as well so they have a similar feeling there with the same WL process.
no different at all lol just friendly competition i guess. anybody can be in any cave at any time
time to go do some real work for a bit
Its the same! Just easier to read messages cos its distributed
Yes sirr the arts are dope and cute at the same time I dont even know how they pull it off 448729b5fb99472a9f64314f6c220303

Isnt it. They should be incredibly proud of themselves. I love it

Congrats to all the giveaway winners!!
But first we grind to get whitelisted
you won!!! gratss!!!!!!!!!  u deserve it seen u grinding
You mean compared to Cosmic Wyverns? I believe both are pretty equal as you get rewarded for genuine engagement in the community and then picked by the Mods and Admin team!
Whats fur balls! Been hearing bout it everywhere
Im just liking the vibe atm.. still got a lot of reading to do to get a feel for whats being proposed
didnt win the giveaway. Ill have to do it the hard way I guess
Nice job! Happy for you! congrats!!!
Its okay bro more opportunities for giveaways
Probably the most positive discord Ive been in regarding a project!
I think its going to be a fun time even though i dont have any nfts there
Congrats to thsoe on the WL. Well done!!!!
hey morning other HENRY how you doing today my brother
Ayyy many rerolls but congrats to the winners!
And youre a whale too  hope they come out some gaming like CK VX too fused with sandbox it will be great?
Congrats to all the Winners !!! 
Yeah looking forward to that side of things getting sorted.. I guess we see it as a necessary evil but it has actually stopped me minting a few projects the last couple of days
not always though. it can backfire
ill just have to grind and grind and hope I get in whenever they take the snapshot
Good morning twin!! How are you?
Yeah bringing NFTs to the main stream
Keep it up mate! Hopefully we see u around
All Hallows Eve and the scariest things is your boss!
Really hope they increase it to top 300
I love how this two cave works really out! Man congratulations to the winners! You all deserved it
phor shore!!! this is the right mindset rooAwwClap oii
no ser no whale i only have one baby kong hahaha. VX is the future projects with VX are worth researching imo
Can I ask what do you mean when you say necessary evils that stopped you from minting?
you should be knowing how my morning is were twins...
1583000 whitelist spots. I love that this is still so early and everyone still has a chance if they work for it
Oh. thanks for noticing.. Yeah.. Freddie Kruger from MetaMonsters.. maybe a little under the radar but big plans for Halloween
Bro I went to sleep and back and youre still here?
well Im sure a fair amount of people in the top 200 are already whitelisted so It should be the top 200 that arent whitelisted already which could mean being like top 250 might be enough
Just made an origami wyvern check it out in fanart and show some love 
yep we are very early and WAGMI
yup still a lot more opportunities coming
this chat is going like a chicken with its head cut off
Ohh good point I hadnt considered that!
still lots of chances from giveaways
One day i will won a Giveaway !
Yeah for sure its so much more relaxed and actually doesnt feel like a grind at all early doors. Nice vibe.
phor shore they r giving us meni opportunities
So insane how early this is. I love that everyone still has a solid chance! Imagine the group when its only 100 WL spots left. Itll be so crazy!
lmaoooo man they dont need a costume!
Already waiting for next give away
Very happy to see a familiar face winning the giveaways 
Definitely had too much going on gas is too high and need more liquidity before jumping on too many others.. time to switch all focus here I thinks
We are early cuz this is an easy 100k project! Lucky to be part of the early fam
well its friday so work is gonna be chill today gonna be going out with some friends its gonna be fun but im mad tired from lack of sleep hbu HENRY hows your day man
Hehe absolutely terrifying really. Whats everyone dressing up for Halloween ??
yes top 200 will make sure you get it but if you dont quite get there then you might still be ok if your sub300
i hope by the time we able to mint wyverns the gas back to normal haha it also means no fomo anymore to dogs coins
Just checking out some of the other channels..  Rage hey !? A place to vent  good idea
Although I have fallen in love with the Wyvern project I dont wish for it to get 100000 people because that just brings the wrong type of people and potential scammers and botters as well!
Awesome! Im top 240 right now but still gonna grind higher!
yessss sending luck ur way PeepoHeart
LOL thats literally my day as well. Im just at work talking on discord and only had like 5 hours of sleep cause i was talking to discord
The more people we interact with the more familiar faces we will see in this chat! 
NFTs ruin my sleep schedule too
yeah we good just gotta have the right ppl
Sounds good! 861687609490276382 861687609490276382
Luck is great but most of life is hard work.
nah youre just copying me bro.. i just got my work laptop to the side and just chatting over here LOL
hanging out on discord and listening lofi wbu
Lets hope so it will be all presale so were safe
I think everyone in the early stages get swept up by it all.. but the recent pullback has been a timely reminder to try and select projects a bit more carefully  hunt out those future blue chips..
Exactly! Thats all we need. We need passionate people that are diamond hands and willing to invest in the project long term AND HOLDDD! 
Man I am hyped with these give aways we should do the rest of WL like this I am loving it haha
Bro youre lucky im at my desk trying to not get caught.. sigh
hey yall its my turn to write something
I did hear something about the team closing the discord off at a certain amount of members Ive seen quite a few projects do that now. It promotes a really healthy and organic community which is perfect
We r all luck to get a head start
Awesome quote! Agee! The harder we work the luckier we get!
Hes epic I have a couple of them too but mine arent great yours is one of the rare monsters! Damn I want that Art Wars ticket 
time for some real work for a bit
i am having fun and chatting on discord I have sent request
I think everyone in the early stages get swept up by it all.. but the recent pullback has been a timely reminder to try and select projects a bit more carefully  hunt out those future blue chips..
congrats to all the giveaway winners  
yeah hope more actives win. altho the actives could get it through top 200 all the same kek 
rpm40hoon I Wyvern randomcbosh Prayge thanks
im work from home LOL yoo i was gonna go in person but i cant chat over here if i do...
for sure! it can be challenging but there are meni opportunities
Yes bro! Loving this community. WAGMI
holanihao yeah! Theres no such thing as luck alone! Hardwork what makes that luck exist!
challenging but its worth it in the end
Hows everyone doign this morning
i can see this project will be bombarded with more people soon
Honestly once the WL is decided and the project is close to launch that is the best thing to do. Create hype internally between the members and dont let other gets their eyes on you.
Nice man im only wfh monday and tuesday.. so sad.
sicck art and we have TWO chats
Hey Muiz. I was just referring to the issues with Eth gas fees recently.. Its been so expensive but obv. has the biggest community netowrks and I feel still the best projects.. so if you want to get involved then you have t o pay those gas fees sometimes
Precisely! Prevents all those nasty scam bots as well
doing good randomcbosh!! how are you
HENRYYY wow thats so sad.. im always gonna be remote till like may and then its gonna be  a hydrid model so hopefully only go in twice a day
hybrids arent bad either PeepoHeart
Im going to dress up at a Wyvern I think
Same here haha need to have a proper sleeping schedule and plan ahead health is wealth my brotha
just make money off dog coins and boom gas fees settled
hopefully if the project explode even more they up it to top 250 or top 300 or top 400 hahahaha hahahaha
Lein  ALPHA RONINS HELLOOOOOOO HAHAH how are u today?
We almost need a third chat. Cave 1 is insane. I cant keep up with replying the conversations move so quick
cave 1 too fast cave 2 just right
That is easily possible but dont aim for most ranked at all man because that would leave you exhausted.
Yeah I got into MetaMonsters for the Art Work lotterey too
yea i really prefer talking in here over the other chat
WAGMI all WAGMI!! giveaways is our desitny
Until they all realise this is the chat to be at and cave 2 starts getting swamped hahahha lol
i like the one minute slow mode here ahahha
Man! Hope we all get the WL trust buddies! I hope everyone gets it! No one left behind!
10k in the net two days i suppose
Yup I think in the next few hours we will hit that!
Yo the main chat is FLYING cant even type there

cave 2 is much more chill hahah cave 1 be flying by
is that so? i dont kknow that haha last time i was there it was 45 sec. Thats cool
I will sleep and wake up and well be at 6k
Both of them have had a 1 minute timer for a long time. Where you been? 
Man Cave 1 be having 50 messages per second 
I am good too. Thanks for asking
i think at one point they made it 30s yesterday and it was a complete shithsow
Oh and thats also a good sign.. An hour timer for suggestions so it cant just get spammed... pretty smart.
i was there for a bit with the 30s timer
im sure it was 3045 sec yesterday
LMAO so hard to keep up with the other cave
Ive been doing that for like 10 hours hahah
seems to be VERY possible !! shakecolors rooAwwClap
Man I think we all need Cave 3. React to this if you agree!!
rly I thought it was always a min
How has the shills channel be shaping up  Any good alpha out of there ?
yeah with people aiming for top 200 not having slow mode is a recipe for disaster haha
yeah 1 min is perfect since we can only have XP once per min
Bout to get a coffee bro what are you doing?
Thats sooo cuteee hahah how are you buddy!
just woke up bout to head to school cry
im all chill if theres an interesting comment then i make a reply cba talking to myself  yelling HYPE LFG WAGMI

Idek bro I guess skipping college when it rains helps alot
Thanks man I went to sleep and thought Ill be over but now in back
Hygiene first before everything

Of course man hbu KietHoang  and u man
its getting onto the colder days here as well onto winter soon
Great to see you too how have you been?
Doing great thanks.. but its 11pm here so not much of the day left
Well Im happy that its getting more utility because this project is so good that it should have more desirability i mean the baby kongz that is.
Yess i had a great sleep. Thanks for asking
Im good. Trying to work and be in here at the same time. Its a lot but fun!!
Good bro! been chilling in here all day almost time to sleep for myself
This is India here the weather changes every 3 months
7eth floor for a NFT with no announced utility in a bear market. I think its only uphill from here. actually im guessing itll hit 5.56 e
Welcome on board buddy. Im here for the long run
multitasking !! guud skill to have
Go and rest bro totally worth it
Guys if you struggle with your mental health theres mentalhealth  Section here Im willing to listen to all of you!
LoL. We all are of the same kind
its hard to find something like this anymore haha. All the new projects are like a race to the bottom right now. After reveal all the common one will get undercut so hardd
yeah i feel chill man. have a great day
Cool cool when you sleeping though?
same prefer cold weather myself
Singapore! Nice never been to netherlands before would defo want to visit it someday
Yeah so true. That even without anything and in this market it didnt drop to any extreme heights which the Mice and Orcs went through so the floor price for babies will rise. What kind of utility would you personally want?
Youre a real one!! Thank you for looking out for others
Any project like this is good long term holds I reckon
i like the cold weather too it can get cozyyyy  drinking dat hot tea
Kaiju is honestly doing so damn well
Muiz some banana generation wouldnt hurt xD. 50 per banana ill take it
it never gets cold where i live
sitback relax and enjoy the show
It will be cold if we have like celebrities and youtubers who help market this too. Like gary vee or sth.
Kaiju is like the only project now down rn haha
best weather people who like heat r crazy
100 the roadmap definitely makes it so people will play the diamond hand
yep if I get it im holding for a while
White list will be early christmas present
did you get the mint on that? nice looking kaiju
Yeahh likewise. I would love to visit singapore on day.
welcome to cave cave 2. WHere its chill and stuff in here
yeah kaiju is like some anomaly in this bear situation haha. I wonder if there will be some spot left for project with similar utility and art like wyverns in the market tho
Hot Cold and Rainy 3 seasons are not there? One In
man you should see how far kong went down mice and cool cats too. gen kong was 200 eth floor 1 month ago its now hovering at 100
Hahah or maybe a new currency even like minibanana which has its own standing.
Sure buddy! Always here for everyone! Im not here for a race. Im here for everyone! I really love this community thats why
yeah also cos i am slow cant catch up with so many messages
what we think floor will be boys
ha heat i feel useless Winter is controlled but summer is a control prophet
Great!! You love to see it. Legend
isit cold in the netherlands rn?
yes if you sell below we will find you
Dude dont think about the floor! Think about the long term utility it can bring so that diamond hands are favored and are the ones that make the real gains.
im doing great! how are u doing??
SHEEESH holy shit down a whole 100eth and KuroJPEG yeah i did! Got super lucky with WL
Go for long term beo.diamond hands. This project is for the long run
definitely gamification such as breeding and token generation is super fun. alot of ppl want it and kaiju and kongz may be a little to exp for most ppl.
Muiz thats not a far stretch could definitely be something to interact with your VX
Yep that is what I love about these projects if paper hands appear they get swept right up too
Yeah we want ppl to never ever want to sell ever no matter what
Definitely health and family over anythin
Thanks man! Appreciated it. How are you? Hows your mental health going?
Uhmm kinda. Its not freezing as of now. But it is rainy and windy
ayy congrats my man! jealous haha
Doing great kinda hard to hold a convo w slowmode
Had a bit of a long one last night so maybe going to crash pretty early tonight
but where are you from Are you from India
You need a good attention span. Must stay focussed ! Haha
hopefully haha. I found a project called hungrybunz Its also got pixelated art and gamification so hopefully they will do good just like kaiju and maybe wyvern
thats why its necessary to try to talk to more than one person if possible lol
bought 600 bananas  50 and got one of my friends has 2 genesis to breed it for me without extra charge p
having fun here w. the Wyverns party
Oh im doing good. Thanks so much
exactly. This project has a lot of factors to be able to be at the top of the project. one of those factors is this amazing community
we always have fun down at cave 2
Thats so great to hear mate! Hoping for the best lucks on your day!
what u guys doing while chatting here?
Kaiju is evidence that when you have a genuinely good project with a strong mentaldiamond hand community this is what happens.
Im at work trying not to get caught haha
yeah a lot of similar projects it all goes down to execution
T v yep got a baby  a vx for 7.5 eth worth asf
helooo everyonee whats going on
That feeling when no one replies to you and you dont wanna spam so youre just sitting there like wen convo
Next give away please so much fun haha
You too man. And not only you i hope everybody else has the best of luck and happiness as wel
does that generate bananas as well?
yeah its like a slow roasting oven in here hahhaa
u in octohedz as well? I got bunch of v2 and i hope it will do well when more utilities are announced and when we out of bear situation i love the art and the community looks great
thats the cost to breed my friend. and if you dont know anyone with 2 genesis then u gotta find a breeder which will usually harge you 620 bananas to breed
mamatt genesis kongz generate 10 bananas per day. 500 per day
Yes bro. Im hoping for the same thing. I get so excited when I see a giveaway notification. Im like a kid in a candy store lol
Hahahah it happens!  we gotta do what we gotta do! p
is this regarding an nft project
Im in PSL in the middle of Miami and Orlando haha. Are you from FL too?

Cant wait for the next trivia  giveaway though!
its 365 days of slow roasting oven here HAHAHA you will defo not like it
Haha this is mor important than work
yes i got in to v2. holding on to 6 right now. hold even numbers since u get 1 VX for every 2 v2 u own. The art is something else so sick
oh i used to be right off of gatlin hahah im in the martin county area now
Damn hahahaha thats kinda though
I would love to see a live video of their faces. I think Id jump outta my sit. Would be a blessing to get a WL spot
Tbh this project looks superrrrrr exciting. Love to see the community growing so quickly too! 
hella tough its super hot here i cant take it
8BitLolitas for sure i also holding 6 haha waiting for vx announcement. Art is really cool i feel like they should be up there with kongz for the genesis one maybe same price with baby kongz for v2 hahhaa but thats just me. Maybe when ink finally announced
cant wait to see how it turns out
anonymice also has a great alpha group.

I came from the cave      ahahah
finger crossed man haha i feel like they really got the potential to be something big
Suprised you replied. Your chat history was very repetitive   exact messages sent in a row. Was bot style lol
anyone know why gas has been so high
Welcome to the best cave. We be chillin over here
Hi best cave welcome a new member
definitely its a very promising project
yeah hahaha its super hot in here. almost everywhere is airconditioned just that we dont usually on it in our homes
Hi welcome to the party !! u are still early bro !
Ill be your Quotespiration buddy in this community!. See ya buddy!
Its getting so cold in michigan
Maybe Animal Coins are too crazy recently
Theres a chance that it can up but it can fall off anytime too
How close is Octoheadz to minting? Has the WL ended for it?
the gas fee is so high right now
Yeah because of shiba inu moonshotting
mitchel hal hey homies whats ur rank so far
anyone planning to get back on animal crossing?
Welcome Bro! Yell out if you need a hand with anything. Otherwise reach level 2 to make sure youre set for the giveaways. Good luck bro
100 but this stuff is all about the long term potential too! And the crypto market is still really small
v2 finished minting like a week ago. but its cheap on secondary rn
Gas fees always high recently so no choice buddy
ive been thinking about it havent had the time tho
I am here too remember to wear more clothes
its definitely a jackpot for someone who bought really early. Someone i know got easy over 250k because of shib lol. He bought really early way before binance listing
This project grow so fast ! in only 3 days
samesies the new update seems fire
We trust the team hal feels great gttq enjoy the community
oooo theres a new update? didnt even know about that will check it out
Ohhh interesting. Well too late for me in any case. Haha.
As if its only 3 days. Thats insane growth.
Thats wild you must be on that 2000 caloric deficit eh 
im not even bothering looking im just talking to everyone i can talk  to lol
Nahh not yet. I about to go and make some food real quick. Because i really am hungry lol how did you know hahaha?
Imagine without invite contest. the server grow so fast !
This cave is so much better i can send pics
It is! It was even faster when we only had own chat room yesterday 
i have faith in them to make the next 20eth nft
honestly not seen anything like it
Cincai  ARKIPEL  Legend yep! and its best that way too. invite contests make for really trash servers
do check it out! everyones been thinking bout jumping back onto acnh bc of it
ayy i have some reloaded as well. pre dope project excited for the future.
its crazy considering theres no invite contest well maybe some are bots but considering there are 2k online members right now from 5.6k thats crazy
If it passes 20eth then there is something special
Yeah just got told! Haha. If I cant catch a project at WL I cant be a part of it because Im new to the spaces so not really a lot of liquid to invest!
Luck is real but bot is bad   Mod are lurking around  
CamzRC yes I like the organic growth server it prove that not bot here
I secretly love the re rolls. I start screaming at my screen saying YOU CAN DO IT COMMMMMME ON hhhahahha
yomsssssssssssssssssssss  seem theres a lot of hype behind it ill definitely check it out later
sad that the v2 wont generate INK but at least well get a free VX mint p
kennayyy honestly anything above 5 right now is pretty special xD
Same thats y gnna diamond hand this cant wait to get vx kaijus
Exactly! Organic growth and just look at the activities here  really amazing!
im a psychic hahaha i can read ur mind!
right lack of sleep is catching up on me.. nodding off at the keyboard  so time for a recharge.. Hope to chat again with you all in the morning
I have never won in a giveaway bot lets make this first time
yeah sad but yeah the VX is something to look forward too 
b4 that bullish on mutant kaijus looking forward to seeing the artwork
hahha i also sold it way early when its 0.000007 for nfts. Didnt really regret it because my gain on nft still a lot more than holding shib. Thats why i said that people who bought early who got billions of shib for cheap really the one who hitting the jackpot hahaah
Lets hope you get lucky. Lets try and win a WL spot!
Hahahahhaa thats crazyy. Nice powerss
yeah the organic growth is really good. glad to be part of here
godzilla in sandbox? bro idm seeing that.
KuroJPEG have u seen the octo VX previews? theyre fookin sick
im thinking of hopping back on as well
and Im back from doing some work
precisely! Ive seen 50k discords with like 34k people online lmao
Cincai  ARKIPEL  Legend yep exactly very easy to tell  mods are good at noticing too
same. the growth have been really impressive!
ofc course haha only the best powers for u
yeah this servers ratio is absolutely nutty
Anyone seen nobody sleeps in the wood tonight on Netflix?
hopefully this will continue even after the competition ends
No but I go back next week  I want to make it in crypto and nfts so I dont need to work anymore at least this year haha
Hopefully we all get WL cmmonn GRINDDDDD
projects wiht 40k that wont even sell 10 of their supply sadge
I usually close my dms if I get a bot dm with a spammy invite link but I havent received none so far from this server hahah
octohedz gonna release a VX. a playable model of your NFT on Sandbox. for ever 2 octohedz v2 you own you will get one free mint of a VX

HENRYYY its vx version of octohedz
Yes! I hope so too! The success of a project depends on the community so its good that we can having so much activity now. Hopefully we wont have botsshillingFuDing appearing later!
eth do be booming hard hoping for bitcoin soon
be organic! join a thread that you enjoy! like movies or pets
yeah so never ever try bot and also we community also help to catch bots
im currently around level 13 or something. which is 8 hours of activity so pretty long
Yo so there are a lot of ways such as engaging with people having geniune conversations giveaways quizzes fan art memes. Most important part tho is quality! 
ye dope af! I also won the giveaway for team fax haha keen to mint that for free
Cant wait for the reveal 8BitLolitas hopefully there is but i think dots is working on it
Just started it. Been trying to watch a horror movie a night leading up to Halloween. Its about a group of teens that go on a camp in the woods and have to give their phones away to ensure they socialise. Lets see how it goes

dang it! Work always hits me at the worst times
i feel you though work has been getting in the way of everyhting
Good luck in getting a WL spot bro.
Hey dude did you get WL for BearX?
Yeah i wish we all could live off nfts  
But dont get too comfortable some secure income is nice!
The harder we work the luckier we get!
Nice Ill let you know how it is when I finish it if you dont plan on watching it now. 
dorsia holy shit maybe its time for me to buy back in kaiju
Keep working hard and never miss any opportunity. Keep treating others how you want to be treated and success will come. Connections and making a strong mindset with strong work ethic is key. 
you too brother you will get there
its always keeping me from doing the things that I want to do
if only most other wl giveaway winners are barely active sadge
chats goin nuts we got a second cave
Man what an event the WL was for that
i feel you but it is work afterall
Just doing some school work haha hbu?
I feel like they wouldnt be as active when they get their wl
Things are getting even more active!
big factss thoo that is rlly hard grind ova there respect PeepoHeart
yep i noticed that they get in and leave
fud will always come before minting time haha. What i hope is that the community will stay strong even after minting.  And please dont get hacked like bearx and other projects
Will do g  Wei hopefully Ill make it one day. Im tryna hit lvl 10 ASAP
Keep vibing bro. Youll get it soon
Sounds terrifying  what else have you been watching ?
yeah I guess so. I just wish I didnt need it lol
they better be or the mods will remove it just the same kek
Oh yes hackers are quite common nowadays unfortunately 
wooow dude  all i can say is get a rest
I hope so hahaha if they do damn this project is a moon shot
dev just need to be aware and careful of what bot they are using and not clicking on any suspicious link at all i guess no porn for the devs until minting time lol
You think theyre gonna do that? Its going to be hard to fill the whitelists then if they are just going to kick inactives out
861687609490276382 861687609490276382
Even i got it idk how they getting into so many proyects
oh yeahh for sure. Also just dont respond to dms
Watched this one called haunted house. Was actually pretty decent pretty gory. Been watching a few of the og horrors like saw and Halloween. You into horror ?
ooo welcome to Wyverns PeepoHeart
they are hacking But there was 1 friend with me his rank was 280 at level 9 only.
they will check the ones they give wl and were doubtful about.
thanks the rest im going to take a rest kek
Hahaha. Well maybe they can indulge but just dont download or click anything weird!
Who will be here at the pre sales ?
Yeah I like being scared witless. Hereditary was the last scary film I watched. I also love m night shalaman
Two caves and the chat still moving too fast lol
What we expect from an awesome team
Oh yeah when they do a whitelist ofcourse. But they probably wouldnt kick people with whitelists
or just use their phone or other device like their smart television! hahahaha
Ooo I gotta suss m night shalaman never seen that one before
Ohh pretty good deal since its at the high
probaby bc the chats r popping offff eyess rooAwwClap

Maybe lol somewhat hurts to look at on mobile
My plans for today is finish all my work haha hbu?

Holymoly  Legend Malaysia bro Hbu
Gotta finish the school work first before everything 
Last 70 spots will be given thru twitter giveaway bro! You can enter if you like. Who knows you might get lucky!
lol what a stupid pass hahahaha. But i heard its because one of the admin got hacked because of installing some .exe
Ya should wait out eth still going to another ath
Nice password lmfao  sucks they got hacked I heard about it really hope everyone in chat is all g and they can fix it without hackers being able to get any wallet acc
hopefully I wont be needing that lol
Cincai  ARKIPEL  Legend Im from malaysia too 
kennayyy wait do we have a rank system here  ?
Woohoo just made level 10! Whos at level 10 with me ??
sounds about right. they got totally ran
dont worry it is friday things will get better
Yeah at botcommands you can look up your rank by doing !rank
Do it in every project   u deserved the memelord nametag
Holymoly  Legend hahah we come from the same country
their discord still going strong tho. NGL I was skeptical but now joining their twitter giveaway lol
Okay nice to know that! Hope the project does well dude! I couldnt get the WL but rooting for my friends that did get in!
Hmmm you lose 100 if the battles you dont take !!
yea someone posted a fake discord nitro which downloaded something. but for some reason he thought it was a good idea to launch the .exe file whatthe 
dorsia yeye im trying to liquidate half of my profile now
cool mate thanks for the information !
Thank you bro for those warm comments!
ive had whitelist for them for a long time. it made me really sad. they had 12k entries on their discord whitelist giveaway
Yeah I heard this too. It has to suck for the creators the hype on the project was insane. The hack wouldve lost alot of trust in the community!
Lets goo level 10 is crazy you got this!
Holymoly  Legend of course. Glad to help
Yh usually this is the case bc most people have 2fa. But with discord token u can bypass 2fa
Just need to keep engaging with everyone !!
yea i know a lot of people that worked hard for the whitelist sucks to see what happened
yomsssssssssssssssssssss wow congrats dude
wallets are safe they just transfer like 80eth ish to the hackers wallets but still should take extra precautions
Everything broke up with btc next year
Im BearX Fam too  dun ignore me
its whatever. im still minting it though 
Holymoly  Legend wow Malaysia how do you like it there hows the weather
At this rate its gonna take a couple months for the whitelist to be fulfilled lol
Repping BearX with the Jungle freak PFP  did you avoid the scams?
They did increase the price for the mint right?
eth tired out the abusive relationship
Still pretty intense work done!
They had a field day! Thats insane! Massive down fall to this crypto world is hackers can get away with it all so easily. 
Tbh i was really salty not getting the WL for bearx for the first drawing competition hahaa. Im faster than my friend and did it right but didnt get it while my friend got it
Yeah to help ppl that got scammed
haha congrat now go for that 200 spot
Yeah Im worried about how much time I need to commit to this now lol
weather kind hot everyday damn 
hot and hotter everyday nid aircon 
ppl bound to get scam unfortunately
yep crypto space is not regulated. any legal action threatened cannot actually be followed through
What did you have for breakfast guys
Sounds like they are trying to make up their problem by charging other users more
for sure !! LETS GET THAT top 200 SPOT!! party
Nice! Crazy how those went down
PekingCow  ARKIPEL for level 10
Holymoly  Legend haha same here in cali now its cooling down and we are getting some rain though how is rainy season there i heard sometimes it can be troublesome
Yes but he didgo all the way to Level 13 and its commendable
i got it with the quiz. i was super super quick with it
Its not bad honestly. The mods are always watching and theyll bless you soon enough. I know they had a whitelisting spree for meme page and artworks. That might give you a higher chance to whitelist if you make them laugh
really sucks what happened to them
Its in my sights now  Im coming for them
Def nid aircon so i can get real chill if not im going rage  channel
ico  oh really? will cause flood?
I cant get through the quiz i cant pass the capcha
KEKWaddle  this GIF thooo lmaoo
a whole lot of catching up to do
go rage channel and release all ur rage bro
Holymoly  Legend no nothing that serious we are in a very major drought so we take anything we can get lol
Yeah ofc lvl 13 its crazy well deserved wl
I made some computer art my pfp but it dont make the cut going to make one more and then try another star style. Seems Hand drawn in favourable !
i didnt have a captcha i hesrd a lot of other people did and idk why i didnt get one. was super excited to tho
ico ohhh I see gotta becareful buddy where are u from?
Sucks so much. So many people would loose money. I see so many rug pulls and hackers. Its quite sad
What really interest me is that eventho its completely hacked and people been warning each other about it hell the discord basically screams hacked but people still mint it for the next hours
probably best to do some art now
visual swim hand drawn ones might be the way to go!
Aight gotta go see u here next time
ive seen many of these discord hacks now
Sadly you cant reach some people
Holymoly  Legend california feels dryer than the sahara sometimes haha we got our first rain in extremely long last weekend
Yeah I assumed. Hopefully they do help the people that got scammed and this way the community helps out the community.
meowth yea it sucks but hey if you can get away with it it just attracts more bad actors
kennayyy  fanart is awesome too
they are just hope the hack didnt kill it
Yup they had a vote and majority voted to help out the community 
The higher ones got WL tho so they might be excluded from the rank 200 WL. Or they might just get two who knows. That would be cool
nah no we are building up the community very well
Can only hope. I cant imagine the guilt they would have knowing they stole from others. Like this is all the money some have and theyre trying something different to make a future for themselves.
you guys checked out the latest sneakpeek ? looks like a winner to me!
Nope should be just 1 so its a top 200 without the people on the WL already
oh cool I love california view is pretty chill and enjoy
should be happy finally got a chill weather 
Yea! With their skills they should have been able to do so much more things that add value to peoples life. SMH.
for sure! it looks real dope tbh
yeh facts bro i dont sleep either
I mean do the whitelist start over or what?
In the discord the hacker basically just spam message over and over again. If people even got just a tiny little bit awareness about this thing they should really they wont mint lol. It just scream hacked i got like 3k ping from the hacker on bearx discord. It just shows how ignorant some people are to these cues
Its always nice to see a project do well. Im in Furballs a cool on chain project and Im hyped for it!
True. You right. Alot of people in the top 200 are Whitelisted so we should be good
Hey guys how yall doing today ? Hope you guys having a great day 
i just clicked on it and it was just a picture
I know it was like 1k notis on bearx lmao but sometimes the fomo hits hard i guess
Yeah really makes you wonder eh 
why dont you grind deeznuts all over your face
then u weak cos u about to sleep my brotherrr
i just sent a response to 3 people with no swear words no excessive caps and no excess use of emojis but it insta deleted it. Anyways BoNFT kucas Holymoly  Legend  The rain has been great and we desperately needed it here in cali.
Health first before everything theres always time to grind
thats exactly the plans...hahhaha
feel free to join the party   but first lets get WL here first !
yup was a good thing to see in cali
Im hyped about furball! Ngl i only know recently that Im OG there lol im on their discord since september but didnt really paid any attention until like last week. Heard they got anonymice founder as advisor?
for sure!!! but i pulled an all nighter alrdy
How excited are we out of 10 rn?
this is an awfully good question
ya im here just start raining gonna have a good sleep weather soon
Sometimes its just the bot bro that Carl  guy loves eating msgs
How do you do that black box 8bit
Cincai  ARKIPEL  Legend no luck yet with WL bro? how long have you been here?
Great to see a community like this  everyone is so active
BoNFT got 2 almost 3 inches of rain where i live everythings slowly starting to green up and look pretty again. Holymoly  Legend  ooooh yes rain weather is my favorite sleep weather
And some of it are transaction above 1eth which shows that its someone with big pocket haha

Hello all. Im a newbie. How is everyone going? Congratulations to those with a WL already
Yes ser! They got the Anonymice founder as an advisor and the OwlHoot dev as an advisor and a very experienced punk. The launch is super close. I expect like 710 days maximum!

Thats what you told me yesterday. I thought you would have a change of heart haha
Did a small compilation of fanart  
I feel privileged to be here. This chat looks insane. I hope its great community spirits
Cant wait for my free mint lol. Since its a full whitelist mint i supposed i cant mint more than one if im OG Furball not the other og
Sad we gotta learn to read b4 tbh it specifies its a transfer and not a mint
I am in FL an I dont mind the heat but I LOVE to go be in the snow
BoNFT  yeah glad to hear nothing bad came out of it i remember hearing that from you yesterday. I live in the bay area so i dont get flood warnings.
nice work! nice to see all the sneak peeks in one place and good for twitter!
not really. its 85F at the end of october. i want a winter so so badly. KyleWrap i dont associate with anyone down here for that sole reason
Yes we all get 1 mint but then we can mint more furballs from the FUR we get from farming inside the game so we can get more furballs but a bit later as we play the game.

You have to play to farm the FUR that eventually lets you get more Furballs! 
i drank soymilk for breakfast wat did u have for breakfast?

IamEvaa  Ryu haha yep you wish you had the ability to sweat sometimes but nope humidity has you covered haha ... literally. and dont get me started in Florida man
Heard its like another country up there lol. Just some good ol boys
Fr lmao I wanna go to a cold place this winter since winter here is basically summer haha
well my friend you are in the right place stick around and see if the mods bless you
I can see why its incredible looking. Im sure you locals will have equally beautiful places that are more hidden!
i wanna head north before i melt down here
You havent heard of Turtle Shell Islands? Its kind of like a second Furball because it has the same mod team and similar roadmap as well! Although details are yet to be out but would recommend to check it out!

Fr lmao I need to head north too before I die down here
KEKWaddle lets keeep grindinggg
Oh. How do I do that apart from being active?
Malik24 Thats an impossible question to answer of all time with biggest influence i can give you one name for my top 3 and that would be biggie. For the rest I just cant choose.
u can be top 200 rank   keep going bro
Stop grinding guys  cant get higher rank
Going to the beach at sunset do be giving that kind of vibe you know 
this is reminiscent of the KB24 chat lol love the community love tho. keep spreading it
Now that will be quite the romantic trip. Well have to invite the Misso tho she can be out beer waiter lol
You heard about it? Where did you? 
join giveaways or lookout for announcements and tweets
maybe there will be other competition in the future
Oh . What if I am already top 200. What then?
gotta keep up top200 for the snapshot
ey bro AirWolf agrees w me. so its facts.
Now how could you keep doing this to me 
Youre still here? Keep the grind bro
Sounds good to me lol I will bring my dog to keep her company
IamEvaa  Ryu ooooh yes theres nothing like a sunset relaxing in the soft sand with the harmonic sound of the waves washing ashore
When the snapshot gona be taken?
growing by every second PeepoHeart
Fr would like to go there with my non existing girl 
ahh It was all a dream most influence for sure. Him or Tupac when it comes to influence.
damn 1 hour waiting to send a sms on suggestions lol
we dont know yet pretty sure its gonna be random
It starts high and the price is lowered as time passes
hahaha perfect match. Shed love this holiday so much. Might just end in a seperation hahah
Just messing with you all. I know man.
nope im not botting just testing betterdiscord
You need to keep the 200 until they have the snapshot to guarantee based on that. But honestly just keep genuine engagement over a couple of days and Im sure youll get selected by the mods team anyway!
Doesnt it hahaha who says test test test
It will be when Im at about 205 or something lol
Cave 2 is just a part 2 of cave one
We will get it anyway how is j freak?
Bro for a moment I saw only one person typing what is going on
Malik24 Couldnt agree more. Haha IamEvaa  Ryu not having a partner can be nice though especially when youre young it allows you to find yourself without being held back by a potentially toxic partner.
this is true. i dont know how having a partner at 16 will affect me and my personal growth
It happened to me on boonji. I was devastated haha
Yo man i am doing good too how has your day been
i would hate to know what you felt like
whats the difference of this cave and the other cave
yep but seems theyve ironed everything out
Fr being young without a partner gives you a more enjoyable life and you can chill always and have not to worry about texting anyone
I know man. Thanks for being so helpful.
Hahah bro even if it does happen you will still get the WL because were all early and the mods team will pick us!
chill bro enjoyed thhe beautiful weather outside
thanks man  i been here for a while tho
cool but luckily is after public mint imagine before mint got this case happen 
Fr and its not even a competition
all rigth short on sp500 at 4578 waiting to be out at 4572
hal im not much older but i can tell you that if they support you and you two share love for eachother and celebrate others success without competing it will be only helping you not making things worse.
have you guys check out the sneakpeek ? really stunning. i wish to own one
I have to go out for dinner tonight and Im going to be constantly checking my phone lol
take yours and I ll take mine  Matthew Mole
Dont say that. Say you will get WL sooner .
Just gotta engage with the community bro and Im sure youll get a WL spot
yea dude wouldve been a shit show like creaturetoadzbearx
Oh i see then how are ya? Hope you are doing awesome!
No sadly i could not but thats oke
dang work getting in the way of grinding
I am loving this team makes me super bullish when they are actively adapting
Check out whitelistinfo yall! Love the moderation here!
What are your thoughts on Swampverse you think its any good?
and all are babycry ask for refund like MaskbyteBearX lmao
loving the amount of opportunities that are available PeepoHeart
Yes different way its always good !
IamEvaa  Ryu exactly couldnt of said it better myself.
Yeah it looked like a mad project and the community was insane. Cant belive how quickly their WL challenges closed! Feel sad that they got hacked tho. Lots of trust is broken now
mechwyvern sure ... i strongly believe engage with community and help out each other is the best way to keep our community strong . cosmicwyvern
wow lvl 7 so fast and its barely 6 hrs of casual chit chat..not bad
swampverse looks good a lot of my friends are in the WL already
But im gonna gtg bath then join the party
Have you qualified for the top 200 yet?
Doing good so far nice day on my end enjoying some cold coffee
Its a sweet grind on the way up
time rlly does fly by quick chatting with everyone rooAwwClap
Good morning! Love to see cave 2 popping off
yes ser its always fun chatting with people
Good luck grinding ! u all can make it !
Imma take a bath for a sec and hop in cave 2 again. Brb folks
What flavor of coffee did you drink?
Yeah hopefully that means we get one for cheap
Ahh i see that is a nice place for nice weather but how do you live with such dangerous animals there. Isnt like 7 of the top 10 most deadliest animals located in Australia?
I was recommended to it but when I saw the invite and chat spam I just got out of there. Haha.
well losing 200300  gas aint fun esp now with ridiculous gas prices
Im fine mate just relaxing really how are you? Anything big planned for today ? 
surely..will continue till monday
def not fun but scammer is around gotta raise awareness tou
dont pay attention to that. simply chat about a favorite issue of yours. Time flies and you will be eligible soon
Yeah. Im just sitting back now and watching to see what happens.
Usually just drink some ground arabica beens and usually have it black hby?
Green. Congrats! Appreciate your jokes last night bro!
Haha a lot of people always ask that. If youre in the outback maybe might see a bunch of deadly animals. But if youre living in the city side youre fine  D
im going to keep at this !!! LFGG PeepoHeart
hey guys. whats up?? cooldogevibe
ThePunter people going ham bruh haha
yeah abit sad  for me def will be emotional sad
Cold coffee sounds too cold for this weather 
Hey any artists or coders here in the wyvern fam?
Good morning everyone. Everyone is so hyped here
I am high scoring but not high like you mean haha
yeah defo bot festinactive members. but worth looking into
Holymoly  Legend sometimes u gotta learn it the hard way. i learned through runescape xD
indeed it does! better than grinding non stop
Ohhh ahah i see what time is it there?
Yeah for sure lucky it is fun being in here
ahah I took to long to drink it so it went cold
relic   where are you ranked at the moment?
Bro keep grinding while you shower
Yea man. It was so damn good. Most of the time recreating a classic is an uphill task. But they created a different sort of magic altogether
Favorite game Everyone? Im interested to see what you guys have been enjoying?
most definitely. seems like the case but for the past year and a half we have spent soooo much time together. seems like everything i do in some way is for her
hahaha I learn it but I dint fall becoz my fren taught me well
mhm just meet new frens and time flies PeepoHeart  i forget that i miss my meals too
thats good to hear its friday so we feeeling good probably just going out to the barsclubs tonight halloween weekend you knwo
exactly. If Im not happy I wont have enough motivation to continue this work
its reassuring to have friends with more experience in this space
Yup I also loved some episodes from visions but not all of them hahaha
Well I decided not to involve myself in too spammy invite contest servers so good luck to the people that got in! Did many Kongz jump into it?
ahh nice what are you dressing up as?
yeah thanks Cincai  ARKIPEL  Legend  for the awareness 
for sure! we need trustworthy  loyal frens oii
ayee keep it up fam what lvl are you?
Visions ? Not sure I have watched that
get some rest health is very important
hal wow. thats amazing keep doing what feels right and everything will come together nicely i wish you and your significant other the best of luck. A relationship like that that young is rare thing and is very special and precious.
Ooh thats really great I usually drink matcha or mocha
Lol I got Mod  DM mentioned do not mint 
So true bro very draining if you arent enjoying it
You in Melbourne bro? Im in Brisbane and its only 1 am here
my baby is going to be a ghost for her first halloween and shes pretty damn adorable in her costume
visions as in that anime star wars show? no good
not sure i just found out abt it yesterday didnt get a chance to scrutinize it.
Visions talk happened earlier in anime channel lmaoo
Yeah its the star wars anime style series
oh thats this weekend ? I completely forgot getting old   Sounds nice big parties going on then probs ?
goodmorning everybody hows everybody doing g 
how hard is now for me to get top 200 KEKW
ahh matcha is the best especially as a latte!! One of my favs
Good morning rank neighbor laugh
Ah ok. I din even try to watch that.
Hahah alright! Where did you find it from? Kong alpha?
haha how is she getting dressed up to be a ghost?
im glad you think so. working through ups and downs was a lesson worth learning
Youll have to grind for 2 days but as long as youre active you should be fine! Youre still early
awww that sounds vry qttt!! Enjoy trick or treating! PESHeart
Neither haha need to get one big enough to fit around my belly
Nicce bro. So many Aussies in here!
Oh man. Like Star Wars Visions? I gotta finish that. Loved the first 4 eps. I hope they let more of these creators play in the star wars universe.....seems they might understand it more than Lucasfilm rn
Fr I like drinking it always whenever I drink coffee
spend about 810 hours a day for this place. Its great to have friendly people like you. a great source of motivation for me to continue this journey
 lmao hi  wow they added so many whitelist overnight thats great
Sup kings and queens how are we doing
nothing big just getting together with some friends and doing some boardgames
I havent even started it yet! But the trailer got me so hyped I cant wait. probably weekend binge
yeah quite a lot to my surprise!
so you make it yourself? Thats great
Yea someone just said. Damn oxvampire discord has been hacked
Sup bro ! Oh u got WL ! congraz 
heiii  im doing great ! how are u doing?
just be yourself and you ll make it fam. Check out announcements for latest details too
chill and positive vibes as always over here in cave 2 
Yo how are you doing over there
cant be that bad they got all sizes sir!
hal Oh yes just remember if things get hard push through together and if its meant to work it will work. A side note to add since youre a little bit younger is  dont restrain yourself to a relationship that you are genuinely not happy in because you are scared or nervous to be alone or single again. Being single gives you lots of opportunity for personal growth and expansion of relationships with your friends and family. Do what makes you the happiest always.
Omg fr? every proyect is getting hacked these days
Well good luck to you for Swampverse!
Oxvampires discord has been hacked. Dont click on any link if anyone from the chat is there
Niceee how much time did you spend mate?
sup bro! we grinding?! Gus  ur too kind haha 
im prolly not gonna bother WL there ill get one off secondary post reveal theres usually a dump
Ahhh. Sweet sounds like a nice weekend. But its cool cuz each episode is its own story. So no need to binge if you dont have the time!
Gus  nice to see fellow Star Wars fans in here!
or  giveaways as the owner occassionaly gives out WL spots too
Damn a lot of discords been hacked recently sad
aye keep pushing youve been pushing the ranks ever since i met you 
So many cases happened recently and still going on. Ahhh shit PepeHands
I wonder when discord mods will all use 2fa how can this stuff keep happening
The creators must be so proud of what they have launched. This community is going places
yup same as always. im enjoying the community tho
woah we stil have servers getting hacked
another project got hacked? if it aint blue chipped I aint buying
thanks for your advice. a lot of my time has been spent learning how to be happy with everyone and balance my friends family her all without neglecting myself.
Its the test of times. Hackers are all over discord.
so unfortunate that my swamp verse invites didnt register. Wanted to be apart of that process but guess not
yeah i love this community its great!
yomsssssssssssssssssssss  Good Good pepewow
crazy to think that all these big names project get hacked all of a sudden 
I feel good about this  The Moogliis
Ya everyone gotta be more cautious and aware
I hope so too at this point but also hope everyone in here knows thats its a WL only  project. So any stealth launch is a scam
too many ppl getting scammed now 
Yup star wars is in my blood since my dad is a fan and got me into it before I could talk hahaha
yep going to have some drinks with friends soon then watching college sports tomorrow and halloween on sundy will be a fun one !
Yea man. Need to be vigilant. Serevrs getting hacked  rug pulls all over the place.
Yes pretty much all channels have slowmode
hal Youre welcome and this is very important. I must say you are very wise for a young age and are very aware of potential problems and are very good at identifying them. Keep it up! I wish i had your thought process at your age.
Ive been grinding pretty hard since yesterday
Yeah Swampverse was just spam so I got out of there.  8BitLolitas Well if its not 100 on chain then I would say that the hype will not be that high. Lets see though.
ooooo a quiz probably not gonna have time for it tho 
bro i love star wars i watched all of em omg even the new ones were not even that bad  they could be better lol have you heard about them remaking the old star wars game
We are straight vibing all the way to the top
Gus are you the Gus from Berserk?
triviaquiz incoming GOODLUCK every1
Bro I cant believe my eyes hahaha you crazy grinder glad to see youre a fellow star wars fan and what game are they remaking?
So much positivity in here unreal
Keep going bro! We can do this!
Nice! Good dad. I used to be scared of Yoda as a kid....my dad had a Halloween Yoda mask and I had no clue what this gremlin looking green thing was.  Think the Patty Jenkins movie will save the star wars movies?
We getting some new knowledge in in trivia
Sure hope so the saga is way to good for it to die like this
do you want to hold hands while we grind? that sounds dirty I apologize
oooo hopefully you have time to make it to trivia i suck last time lol i missed 1 question and i was outta top 10 lol.  Gus  you couldnt believe youre eyes or something  the game is knights of the old republic
New Topic! For those of you who play new world Favorite build? I personally use war hammer and hatchet.
Shit thats a bit stiff. What sort of questions were in it last time? All project based?
who likes shibu and who likes doge
i hate both only because im not in it
Is new world is like a RPG game?
Broo that game is sick loved the original one getting the remake for sure
Keen to see how the game plays out
I will suggest moral support as the first step and see how things go after that p
I like dog coins but I dislike how they making gas so high so I cant buy jpegs lol
I love the animals hate the coins
recently gas fees is extremly high
NEW announcements and theres a competition on triviaquiz for WL spots later
i think the same here just memecoins
May I ask if the solo from your name is in honor of a certain smuggler?
the last trivia included questions all bout wyverns like wheres they came from how many feet they got do they breathe fire. was pretty easy imo but this time around it might be different. Gus same here the game was great back then i heard theyre completely making a new game based on it tho like the game mechanics a are gon be way different
Damn get them brains ready for trivia
Its been gross haha hasnt been under 100 gwei in like 4 days
holding hands while we grind might not be very moral. Is that what youre talking about?
yes IamEvaa  Ryu it is an MMORPG  personally its my first mmo not my first rpg if youve ever played the witcher series it is very similar but much better. hal you are very welcome.
sigh why is the gas nv going down..
Ill proly wont win but it will be fun for sure
Ohhh howd you find out the answers? Are they off google or in this discord somewhere?
Would def look into it! I like rpg games 
yeah is really disgusting imagine keep 100 gwei now market of OS should be very slow
A crypto one ! that i find interesting
oh means the trivia will based on the Wyverns?
APDaytrader hey there how you doing 
yomsssssssssssssssssssss hi im good how bout u? hope youre having a great day
Do we just type the answers in the channel and if we get it right we proceed to the next question etc?
If its a star wars game then Im in
there is a latest announcements guys about the WL and how to attain it! Also in 1 HRS time theres a triviaquiz
Yo guys just a warning that 0xvampire discord has just been hacked please dont click any links from them for the time being if youre involved with the project
Haha! Yes. Sometimes I forget what my discord name is! And my dogs name is Chewie after a certain wookie.  You name anything after star wars? Kidspets?
just getting my first cup of coffee in me so im ok lol what about you?
So true I cant see too much happening on OS with the gas like that especially for the little guys
IamEvaa  Ryu sounds great it is one of my favorite games of all time so for ive put probably 50 hours into it and am not even close to finishing. It is a grind but a very fun one. hal Yeah i am ive known him for about 5 years
Any guesses what todays quiz is about?
ETH 2.0 will be epic without gas fees. Cant wait
Damn another one bites the dust lol
somehow i still see high activity for shib token but shib aint having much movement in price charts tho
another discord hacked..how is it even happening???
What is breh oh hmy bad the octohedz
The answers were all kind of cmon sense  you could easily google them tho Holymoly  Legend might be different this time around well see Muiz the last quiz worked in a way were there were they were 3 answers and you would react to em
Well I convinced my gf to name her dog Padme so I guess that counts hahaha
Haha such a long game I really like playing long games haha
when is it ever coming out tho PBpepesitsad
nice coffee sounds good  just grinding here for a spot  its night time here btw in asia
Im guessing it will be about sawcon history
hopefully their mod handles it like the jungle freaks did. Hope it keeps its legs...
yeah kinda pain when gas fees so high 
i like the boonji pfp by the way
hal yeah thats me wbu how do you know him
Shit bro another project. Surely the passwords can be a bit more secure to prevent this
tysm! hope u r having a gr8 day too
No prob looking out for the fam 
bojangles its crazy 8 to 10 projects this week
I see thanks for the explanation buddy
minse096  lol imagine thatDnck  Im having coffee and dabs
i shouldve named my puppy chewy or Chewbacca lol he looks exactly like him!!! 6k members sooon ??
I dont think its peoples accounts that are being hacked. Some people think think its the actual discord and others think its an inside job
Yup I watched the bearx one go down live
Bro chewy its such a good name imo
It does. Sigh....everyone got me All star wars nostalgic. Where in Mexico you from?
Well now u have chance for another one lol
I suppose no one knows what to expect. And I doubt the creators would openly admit to rug pulling it. So shit
Increase community  decreasing NFTs supply utility for NFTs... These are the present trend settings in NFTS
bearx was madness i woke up to 300 notis
are u guys ready for the trivia???? 
very unfortunate indeed! But why are they targeting a DC that has launched a month ago?
Exactly so crazy how its frequent now
Bad it was crazy I am glad I was asleep
yeah i posted him long ago when i first joined the discord  FREDDIE  yeah everybodys beeen thinking that its kinda crazy every time a discords been hacked somehow people are able to explain how they got hacked quick on twitter lll
Yes absolutely 100 I am ready to take the trivia inside me!
APDaytrader thanks just revealed yesterday  gonna frame it up soon 
yomsssssssssssssssssssss alright thanks  what are u up to btw ?
vegasm great way to start the day hehe
My body is ready! My mind is probably not ready 
how long does the quiz take to finish?
Yeah LMAO but I was never involved with 0x vampires as I was with bearx so it was more personal laugh
honestly i just muted the notis when i saw it fortunately i already saw this happen at maskbyte so i knwo whats up
Maybe its gonna take a few mins
Who knows I think anyone will do anything to have control.  So shit
triviaquiz dont miss out everyone
how much time do u have to answer questions?
the last quiz lasted about 1015 mins last time there was 9 questions  might be different this time tho
But with the rate disc getting hacked its crazy man 
A lot of big disc getting hacked like wtf
yeah red flag for sure right there
word thanks. im excited for it. trying to prepare myself for it
Not ready bro im weak in trivia provide some tips 
will the questions be posted in triviaquiz ? i am assuming so.
Yeah I reckon I would hav acted quick if I was awake
Yeah and its all organic! Amazing growth man
How many WL spots left for being active in chat?
Yeah theres no one to blame except the project teams. Its sad that with so many hacks recently projects still fall for it
lmao best way to do it be sure to do research about wyverns and the project information in case any questions are about it
Only 1743000 taken in total. I dont think the mods have released how many exactly will be given away through giveaways
Im from Sinaloa theres some great beaches over here thats all the good things I could say from here hahaha
there should be new avenues to grab some slots soon
it is counted towards general whitelist as discussed on faqs
Hi Wyvern Master how are you doing today
Really ready for trivia hope we gonna make this one guys
top 10 winners for trivia today guys so theres a big chance at being whitelisted GL 
hey Master are u the one provide the trivia ?
I dont think u should blaime the team no one expect jungle freaks to get hacked yet they did its more that disc secuirity isnt the best they need to upgrade with the hackers. What u mean fall for it ? If they get hacked how do they fall for it lmai
I am starting to crash now not sure how well I will go in the quiz
You should probably post it on fanart
Yeah theres fanart  memes  and top 200 active members. Theres heaps of ways to get a WL spot!! ThePunter positive vibes only around here. So pumped
top 200 but there will be people in the top 200 who are already whitelisted so you might only need to be like top 250 or so to get a whitelist spot
im guessing there will be considering the content on the last quiz
Post on fanart altho its technically its an edit of other ppls art
the problem is my trivia is weak 
excited to see whats in store for us
ooo good to see you again hows your day going so far 
Haha. Ummmmm. Stay safe down there? Ive only ever been to Cabo and PV but my dad was born in some village outside Guadalajara. Mexican beaches are great....so hot tho
Yeah it is such a good energy flowing through this discord
Sadly will be asleep. 230 here haha
But post in anyway because its awesome!
morris Multiple choice questions based on the project.
Mate the discords didnt got hacked because of a discord vulnerability that allows you to send messages to a discord you dont own lol what happens is the team members have been getting compromised for exemple falling for phishing attacks or downloading executables and running them when they shouldnt and thats how the discord have been getting hacked its 110 avoidable
Okay thanks! Im about to get up on the wiki and start learning. Haha.
So if i get top 250 i will WL spot?
no complaints if thats the path we take
going well just chillin in here for the morning before i start work  yourself?
Hahaha thank you it really isnt as bad as everyone thinks but it is for sure hot in here
GNaga  WYVERN   its  all from memes fanart 
With this community they have backing the project I see huge potential. Next blue chip? 
theres a chance perhaps! no way of knowing unless an admin confirms
you might because some people are already whitelisted in theirs in the top 200 so theyll be picking the next person over
not definitely but its possible. top 200 definitely but depending on how many people in the final top 200 are already whitelisted you might be able to be outside of the top 200 and still get a WL spot
gonna random answer the question
everyone will have a fair chance at triviaquiz dont forget to participate everyone
wassup! im back from bath hahaha
growth has been looking good so far i see potential for sure
im pretty bad at trivia questions too tbh LMFAO
CryptoGrandmaCultivator   Yeah... too crazy thecave2  is where its at
good luck yall! you know when the trivia is?
corm44   all from snapshot that has not been done and nobodys knows when it will be
So great seeing so many others believe in the project. I love it 
Lets hope is selective question so we can random answer
currently laying in bed rn just boutta get my day started with some coffe  Brausoto should start in about 33 mins
Diamond hands every where I can sense it
yes exactly. the suspense is killing me
Should be in the triviaquiz channel Brausoto it is located right below the giveaway channel.
Fr haha its pretty chaotic there rn haha
it was.. good hahahaha its like 10PM now hot shower at this cold night is really felt good
Seems like pretty hard to get WL lol
Crush the triviaquiz and youll get it today 
it is loool buy hey we need to keep trying bro
yup i love those questions that you can answer without thinking just common sense ones
With such minimal wyverns available anyone would be crazy to sell the opportunity to be apart of this!
it will take a bit of grinding thats for sure.
hal if youre still here and want to continue our convo how do you know nx?
Just need to get ourselves in otherwise we will be paying premiums on secondary market
Have you heard about House of Goblin ?
Or just random pick the answer 
maybe common to you.. maybe not common to us
just from online weve got a lot of mutual friends and were in the same nft trading group lol
i feel you  i dont want to get out of bed either
Yeah and to be extra sure top 100
lmao yeah or you can do that and randomly get it right but gotta be careful since it wont count if you click the wrong answer first HENRY hey last time they had how many feet does a wyvern have like cmon who doesnt know that LOL
bed is my home so cozyy NezukoSleepingBag
what time exactly is the giveaway?
ya   too many ppl are fighting with u  so all the best 
haha thats funny hal small world hes a very smart and talented kid. Hes going somewhere in life.
oh that doesnt seem that bad they have 10 right
road to being noticed by ShihTzu  senpai
there will be a trivia quiz in less than 1h in triviaquiz i dont think any giveaways are currently set to happen
i dun feel ready for the trivia at all
How many do they have tho asking for a friend
no set times on giveaway theyre given throughout the day. HENRY i honestly thought the answer was 4 at first
Either bro Im not the smartest cookie. Best we can do is give it a go
Itll be easy to see what the right answer is as folks will swarm on the right one haha
was all about wyverns lol like where they came from how they looked stuff like that
yeah I know   but I will follow the majority LMAO
I thought that as well cause their wings are kinda like feet cause they support on them
drinking coffee and kicking ass
I will check on it. Seems suspicious
mann we needa squad up and work together
evening guys. hows everyone doing
LMFAO i feel you bro it will be worth it sneakpeek legendary finally came out am so happy OOGA
CosmicWyverns just posted a new Tweet!
Trivia quiz contest happening on our discord in a few minutes.
Top points get whitelist. Join us there now. 
Trivia quiz contest happening on our discord in a few minutes. 
Top points get whitelist. Join us there now. 
Why ? Its the way to get more info about house of goblin nothing else...
So is it like you respond with an emoji response? If theres so many people swarming it how do they figure out the leaderboard?
BouncyBear doing great ive been enjoying the past hour in thecave2  Cave 2 ontop
hmmmm of course the trivia contest will probably come when I have to go do some real work
he like keep talk to himself and random reply 
oh its nothing to be proud of generic medium roast dunkin k cups
i thought that was right but sometimes the majority was wrong lol you can tel when all of them realize and star switching their answers around hal theyre saying around top 10 this time 
Yup just click on a react. 1 of 4. After every round the leaderboard is shown
if youre talking about the quiz its top 10 brother
Yupp that 11 animated is sick af and the lightining effect chefkiss itll all be worth it in the end forsure PESSadGePray
where do i study wyvern language and wyvernology?
nice. the chats here much better huh
Shit so if everyone gets the same answers how do they figure out the top 10? 
wyverns in general yea? need to do some google search for research now haha
Yep hahaha watch all his replys kinda ammusing
its also based off speed of whne u react
i stay guccid down to the socks  biggie
BouncyBear Oh yeah very much so Cave 1 is a little bit of a mess. Sadly it might be due to botted 1 part conversations.
Well its on a points based system from 5001000 per round. Fastest correct answers get more points
Anything new going on in here???
awh man i dont want you searching the wrong things lol it might be different this time around  maybe itll be trivia about the project
100 it will be worth i see you climbing so just keep it up kinglove
Oh im excited for trivia baby whos taking this one home
they also count how fast u answer. so if u choose faster ull get more points if u get it right
I just read that. So crazy what a bot can do in this chat. I love it
for sure coffee is so addictingg PeepoHeart
yup and if you choose the wrong answer youlll be able to change it  but you wont get points for it
it amazing..seems like its been programmed to ask some random questions
it also could be about the project yes hahaha oh well google search is on my tab
the chat cooldown timer here is 1 min?
Honestly the winner will we a lucky guy who blindpicks the right answers right away
Ooo okay sending more positive vibes in then
Yall know what kinds of questions they asked last time?
Just sit back and enjoy bro ticks all the boxes
BouncyBear Yes that is to keep down the overall madness and spam I believe it also has something to do with the Mee6 bot
Well soon find out. Got to answer it quickly and correctly. I wonder what the topic is on
yeah only blindpicking 10 questions not that bad
yup its also 1 min here it shouldnt matter because xp given goes by the minute  randomcbosh just questions about wyverns like theyre origin and their descriptions
Anything special abt this project?
hmmm. 1 min is a bit long. haha. 30 or 40sec would be nice.
Blind picking 10 right answers in a row is insanely unlikely no shot
It will be around one topic ? likes movies ?
i drink mine with half and half
you gotta at least put some thought to it!
Strong community which is crucial to any project!
I have to if I want to feel antihyng
nah you honestly have to get all of it right if you miss one you wont be in the top 10 best to take your time i dont think blindpicking is gon always pick the right answer 
agreed BouncyBear  but it is what it is it makes it impossible to have 2 conversations at once but on the bright side it only keeps the good and on going conversations in motion
Last one was on Wyverns! Well have to wait an see what they decide could be anything
Great artwork roadmap and an amazingly uplifting community
Feel free to help yourself with it lol
Art rarity mint price mods are super busy and doing all the right things. removing bots and a fair white list plus the communitys energy is insane. And I have probably missed a lot more lol
hows everyones moring hope everyone is doing well
Wait where do i find out about the origins of wyverns  
HENRY Yeah gotta think fast tho!
my mornings greattt waiting on that triviaaa goodluk everyone hows ur morning going?Think
minse096  its just insane trying to mint things
will probably be the lowest for awhile
true. agree there. u gonna try the quiz too?
Yeah but it kills the vibe. Theres always going to be people who endlessly NPC post or set up bots which is why Im kinda surprised theres an activity contest to begin with. The idea is to build a tight community not WL people who are going to flip and most of the time it appears that the people who bot and NPC comment are the ones you dont see a couple days post mint.
Google lol these trivia questions are tough
anyone seen the latest sneakpeek go react now guys
 a friend bailed me out I thought you heard?
yea. most of them who grind for lvl will disappear post mint or some even fail to mint. worst of them will just list below floor to undercut everyone
I had egg benedicts this morning what about you?
Id love to hopefully we dont just bring each other down  
v1 Idk how imma get any wyvern questions right 
maplestory taught me a lot bout wyverns boutta take the win   hopefully
Hey guys this is just a quick PSA.
Dont be like wenis and steal fanart of others
Especially dont delete it the second I call you out for it and then proceed to ignore my messages here and DM me with Shh you saw nothing bye bye to our fallen soldier wenis! 
wow i hope i can get in   i been trying hard on my application to be a wyvern myself.. im just a frog
I would like to say no but deep down yes i guess
LMAO he really messaged a mod you saw nothing 
lol whoever u are wennis u just got called out haha
BouncyBear Yeah Im going to try my best ive been fairly active and I hope I know the answers! Cryptom173    i would have to disagree the activity contest which I feel is the wrong word for it is heavily monitored and no bot will make it through. The staff here work hard to keep things fun and top quality. Lets cut them some slack and look at the good coming out of all of this.
lol. this is epic. just dont bother if u are just gonna steal other people work man.
Yeoooo i think my cousin went there 
dont steal arts from your fellow wyverns
word thanks. this is my time to shine then
The ones that list below floor blow my mind man. Like theyll commit timeeffort to getting WLd then immediately dump to make a couple buck or more hilariously dump at a loss. Like you just spent a week to get this and immediately took a loss on it?!?
yup trivia quiz will start while Im busy with work unfortunately
come on get higher  matt nathanson ah nice smooth music to wind the week down..
BouncyBear Unfortunately thats how our society is today anytime someone can capitalize off someone else even if it leads to their downfall or misfortune they will do it. It is truely sad.
o i used to get scared and stuff from halloween costumes but tbh i dont believe in it
not saying they are bots. but some people just do it to get into wl and they disappear after. i know of people that even offer services to grind for ur account to get whitelist. just pay them and theyll do it for u
sometimes it pumps and sometimes it dumps
i mean all he did is saying heeyyy in chat so it didnt really surprise me when he stole some art lol
20 minutes guys get readypepepoggerschain
Halloween stuff are cute tho haha
still deters a lot of flippers tho i doubt youll catch people being on a chat for their whole day just to sell as soon as they mint. and hey if they do more wyverns for us at a discount!
Ah well yes Im out on bail now. Dont worry tho I will be on best behaviour officer
time is going quick. Im nervous
bot has been preprogramed to say roar amazing technology nowadays   jk
yea. dont get them. they can even sell below mint. why would u bother to even go thru everything and pay gas then list for below mint price? makes no sense
Ive been free most of the morning and the quiz will fall at the one time i wont be free lol. just my luck
15 minutes before the trivia quiz!!!
its alright! just remember there are hundreds who will take part in the quiz and only 10 people will get it its no biggie if u dont get in
Okay that scream mask is pretty scary to me too ngl
Cave 1 is nuts cave 2 is nuttier
its just keeps on giving! dont stop please
BouncyBear Wow. I didnt know about the services people are doing. This is a great project Im here for the unique artwork and process that it goes through with organic growth and I intend to stay active in this discord regardless of whitelist. Wyvern is pioneering the idea of organic growth and im very excited for its future!
yeah thats right. Still worth trying. I might get lucky doubt it but never say never
You guys are able to see the type of questions they asked if you scroll up in the triviaquiz  channel to get a feel of whats to come
I can have a bite on the other side of the burger 
Faudi still waitin on you to take 1 bro wya
how they keep hitting ATH sheeesshers man ETH the mooner
for the quiz that is happening soon
I am looking forward trivia quiz!!!
LOL i was crying when i was little dude that costume is so fken scary
ill have to try to do the quiz on my phone while also working. that might not work for me
exactlyy thats the spiritlfg lfg lfg
Hahahaha he got me too Elea  what is the ex presidents name
sorry hyxder i cant over take a botter
but we dont know the content of the quiz what would we even study for lol
everyone and their moms bouta own ETH now that Facebook became the Meta
Lll this is my favorite comnunity
yooo that epic is that five guys?
too advanced for him too early smh  
Hyxder  he called you out again  cannot compare to you
GoodLuck Everyone! triviaquiz  dont miss it out.
CamzRC   yomsssssssssssssssssssss im good  yall still hanging in there!
whoaa im so excited with the trivia quiz!
yeap. grinding service for hire. haha. well i think if people love the art and believe in the utility and the team many will stay and contribute
how could you do this to someone 
i dont think my mom would buy ETH bro she dont even know what crypto is
can we get hint so we can quickly study for it hahah
Hahahaha I will get it soon been super sus
Everyone take my energy for this trivia!
how do you guys keep getting people with dn jokes? 656884642649079839
not good for NFT market he prob has more in assets than liquid atm
my mom just bought into dwac after I told her it was a bubble and then it proceeded to drop 50 in one day
trivia always fun for whitelist tests your knowledge on the project  and rewards you for it 
Yo guys what r u doing on weekends
Facebook is trying to rebrand but it wouldnt matter to the people using FB and the other stuff and it would certainly not introduce them to the NFT or Crypto world.  Hahah. Thats what I think though. Because its a unique world this one.
yeah i like it. Not sure if I can participate in this one though
BouncyBear Exactly thats precisely why Wyvern has decided to go down the route of rewarding community activity. Its a great idea and im sure it will workout. If people truely feel passionate about this project like they say they do they will stay.
wait til i tell wendy... Souhate
yea doesnt it means bad for nft?
Yes ser. I have made a truce with their higher ups. We are good now
my weekends are pretty busy i normally get stoned and spend minimum 1 hour a day crying in the shower
Did the trivia quiz happen already?
I agree theyve been getting a lot of the bots. The thing is typically when you have someone with the time to post all daynight youre dealing with kids for the most part and theyre not going to hesitate to take 200 in profit especially if they dont understand tokenization. I have zero interest in listing projects like these. I still have like an eth in moose trax thats probably worth like .1 rn so I just keep staking. Its a completely different model than this I thinkhope but giving something a daymonth isnt really giving anything a real shot. Think about how many people dumped genesis kongs at a loss back in March and never got back in... Models can be improvedchangedadapted as long as the team is reasonable.
yup. lets hope this project works out! loving the art too! where r u from btw?
awh that sucks its starting in about 10 mins too damn was hoping you could play
TheCoaster  starts in about 10 mins in the triviaquiz  channel
Hey youre from Eve right I remember you how is it going fren kinglove
ooo i read they r changing facebook to Meta
well she needs to get on it before it hits 6k! 
JuwulKruztul hahaha i knew u were gonna say that! no problem tho because i know my wyvern lore 
wendys good but innout is better hannah
goodluck to everyone dont forget triviaquiz coming up
Yup! Building a community with passionate members is a better bet and I think we will benefit from it!
have you guys ever had five guys
no problems at all......i thought that was most people did on the weekends?
Cryptom173   agreed. its a sad truth but i believe in this project and as long as they continue to deliver i have no doubt it will succeed
That is of course right when I have to go do some lunch duty at my school so Im going to try to participate on my phone as best as I can but it might prove impossible. Ive been free all morning and they pick the one hour Im not free of course
it is I  remember you too you was always chill af. Going great my man  vibing in here just outside top 200. Finna smoke some dudes on trivia haha. How you doing
Yes! Facebook re branding themselves and I honestly think its of no use. They are trying to look cool to the technical world for sure though.
ShihTzu do you have any info on the token emission supply andor burn rate? Im assuming this is a modifiied kongz model but wanted to get more info
who is going for the triviaquiz ?
ive had that i dun rlly like it
i dont speak enough english to understand...
mannn cant say yes but their chili is good
damn just woke up wish some of these giveaways could be in the afternoon instead of demon hours
in n out is def better but wendys be having them 4 for 4 deals  
GNaga  WYVERN   they trying their hardest to fit in leave em alone  
corm44  awh man that sucks hopefully youre able to make time to be able to join in on trivia
yea. totally agree. people with irl jobs and family will not be able to grind for hours here. i think the team will play a big part in any project. if u believe the team is totally committed to it its worth investing. if the team is just making the project to make a quick buck then its just gonna be another pump and dump
Dope thank you. Wasnt sure as Im so busy with work
BouncyBear Im from the bay area in California. Im enjoying the cool weather finally getting some rain. How about yourself. holanihao Couldnt of said it better myself!
But hopefully they can build a good metaverse tho
All the best on trivia everyone !
why not?? ive never had it either
I thought the same thing. Was constantly spamming the same sentence over and over
10 mins Trivia hype train 2750RainbowHyperTada
Do you really think they can? I dont think they have that in them and I dont think their users are interested in such a metaverse either.
alright time to go do some real work for about an hour
HQ Trivia back in sneakers has trained us for this moment you must not fail fren. I been seein you much active in here too so you dont necessarily have to be top 200 to get a whitelist spot just as long as mods notice organic activity you have a chance. I been doing well just chilling on my reading break hence why I have decided to be a degen in here Kek Best of luck to you brotha
ima go eat some hotpot if i hit whitelist today 
Yeh these kinda projects are for hodlers
not much we got trivia starting up soon in triviaquiz  be sure to join!!!!!
corm44  cya later have a good one
ah nice. i have some cousins living in LA. im from indonesia. haha. rainy season here now too. rain every single day for the past 2 weeks already
might have to be late for my next period to do the quiz
Yeah. Kaijus a good example of a project WLing well. I got there too late but hopefully not too late for wyvern
u can google for it it some type of food soup based
BouncyBear Wow is it monsoon season? I think that happens in Indonesia right. LA is nice but too much city for me
100bil from FB ought to build something at least
def not too late for this project
Its technically in the grey area of the law
man HQ be feeling like a lifetime ago what a time to be alive . Yeah yeah I see mods blessing dudes who are just being a nice addition to the community Im just aiming for the top 200 as a safety net haha. No better way to spend a reading break tbh pepeOK
hopefully we finish in time so youre able to go to your next one 
Cryptom173    very early still youre good sitting at 1793000 whitelisted so your still good 
Yeah we still early. I believe we got a chance
Hahahahaha! May the fastest finger win!
ok 7 minutes b4 a quiz time to study
Yup we are still early so lets do it!
Best Day of my life  American Authors spotify
gotta get it done and jump on some work calls lol
Yeh hoping Ill make it here. With 3000 WL I assume is active member will make it
yea. monsoon season till maybe march. then dry season hits for like half a year. we only get rainy and dry season here. but im enjoying the 2329c weather here all year round. so nothing to complain bout the weather. haha
LMAOO fr times were much simpler and yeah deadass would not do it if I didnt believe in projectteam they been doing excellent so far and certainly have a bright future hope to see you with us in the long run fam 
I honestly think its pretty clear its not a security unless youre promising profitroyaltyrevenue sharing tbh.
I have strong fingers says my gf
i figured out the discord invite so i was pretty lucky to get in that late 
it would be nice if there could be some raffle for those who selected the correct answers rather than fastest fingers this could be more inclusive for everyone 
see you on the flip side my fren 
yup you guys are more than safe thousands of whitelists spots to go around for everybody 
TheSoap  woah woah now   what ya tryna say
for suree !!! goodluk everyone on trivia
So is it the first to answer correctly on the trivia quiz gets a point? Or how does it work?   
BouncyBear Wow very different from where i am from we are in a major drought and where i live we get our water from an underground reserve so it can seriously affect us. We are not in city water so its a little intimidating!
yes this is a more chill vibey cave
if youre fast replying to the question it just means you get more points if you do get it right
If you put in like that....hmmmm
thats how i got through college
Dsol de vous accuser dtre un bot
Yessir this is much a chiller chat than thecave also the chillest is chillcave
back when shoes used to actually slap too smh PepeHands . yeah I wouldnt devote my time to anywhere I dont deem worthwhile Wyverns to the moon baby. Ill be here alongside yall dw soon join the green bois chat salute
its Spotify and its playing  How to Save a life  the Fray  now  loving my friday chill music
U click and u are good to go u cant change answer afterwards bot recognize ur answer
I did too but it didnt connect. No point in getting upset when you miss out though. Glad to see theres another project similar to kongz and hope this is another similar model.
awh i think its best to reward those who are the quickest cause if you do the way you just mentioned everybody can take their time
PSA triviaquiz happening in 5 minutes everyone!
ooof im so excited good luck everyoner with this quiz guys!
Yes hope everyone wins! Im stressed out haha
Souhate  ohhh you might do well
wow. never experience drought before. so u guys must be careful with the water usage there? we have flood problems here instead of droughts
Yeh just gotta stay optimistic. This project is very community based rather than tryna get as many people in as possible. These kinda projects are the ones that last. Quality over quantity all the way 
lett prepare for the quiss brooo
Ah oke ! mais pourquoi tu crois ca ?
wym by it didnt connect? either way some people got in and didnt get to mint anything cuz the team entered some addresses twice resulting in some ppl being able to mint twice and some none
true that the lets the bots decide the winners then that way its the most fair for everyone
Aightt will hang around here. the real cave is crazy
kmspepe Things used to be so fun man I hope it gets less dry soon but I been hearing some messed shit bout foots movin to raffles or sum thats the end of an era if it happens sadhug
BouncyBear yeah we try our best we come from two very different types of climates
yes yes good luck to all humans
Yeah US goin out sad if thats really the case PepeYikes  EU already garbage so Im sure theyd follow suit lmfao. Ah well thankful for all the good times smh
hahaha. yea. i spent some time in swiss too. snowy weather most of the time. too cold for me there.
1 token  1 token. On top of that it takes a collective effort to give that token value and a lot of people dont understand what that means. People will get upset when whales get involved but theyre 100 necessary for a lot of reasons particularly when it comes to the LP.
Head on over to triviaquiz and standby
GL everybody on the quiz have fun!!!!!!  1 min til quiz starts in triviaquiz

exactly the middle ground is always the best!BouncyBear I love our conversation lets pick it back up after the triviaquiz !
the quiz is gon be tough i feel like lol
just relying on info i learnt years ago
My apologies to Elea he is not a bot english is his second language. his a great bloke 
triviaquiz IS LIVE make sure to start answering!
Ok that trivia is crazy I legit cant click it until its over 100! Like damn
How do people even know the answers as the questions are released ?
just arrived hope to help out this community 
these questions are so sweird man
Lucky I didnt join I would have been hopeless
I cant react either haha buttons not workin
How are people able to react? I cant react for a solid few seconds I just get to watch the numbers fly so upsetting hahaha Maybe phone was a bade idea
yo Dachshundwizard  Twitch   man congrats! WL haha you are so fast here huh nhhaha
people are super fast wowwww fair play
Just stay positive bro and keep going. Determination will get u the WL
the moment I click it already has hundreds  of reactions
i feel like iam almost at that top 10
seems to be alot of misspellings in the quiz too
Its so hard. Whoever has best internet I gies.
Thanks my friend! Lets go mr banana!!!  
Souhate yo how are you doing heartlove
Good work to the winners !!! You genuinely deserve it because you gotta be fast as f to be first !!!
this is such a difficult quiz I dont understand
or just complete guesses then people hop on to most reacted
yes sir!! happy to be here  hopefully can help out the community 
Damn nitro . Nice to see you helping the community
910 but a bit slow congrats on green man
congrats to those who could win
wow 910 is really dam good tho and ty 
im gonna have to take Ls for all the trivias bc i suk
Same here the Animated one is amazing 
Winners deserve it that shiz was crazy
haha truly people are crazy good
how do they react before we see the answers
how they react before knowing answeR?
Quiz is insane tough fair play to those who got it!
ayyeee congrats on the green name it was just like yesterday you was pink
anyone else think it was kinda unfair where reacts were already happening before the answer
Guys pls report if there are any scripters out here some of them we already banned are salty af and said that they will just come back and make new accounts to script and bot on. This would take out the wl opportunities of those who deserve it so please dont hesitate to reply and ask them if they are scripting or not but ofc do it politely incase they are actual people who might just have missed replying to a message 
haha. got rank 51. how about u?
Will keep an eye out thanks for looking after the community 
solid trivia round!! i would have been in top 10 i think but I got to sweaty. Ended up at 48th
for sure! Ill keep an eye out eyess
i did horrible this time around  
space  aye congrats on the trivia win  well deserved that one was tough for sure
damn i only made it into the top 20
is this why people were answering before the answers loaded
Ryu I will keep my eye out. For these scriptors are they just people that already have random stuff written and they post on interval?
yea I gave up after like 6th questions lol
do some people get it early or what whats with the lag in between the choices are given and the answer?? to vote
how are all of them no chats ??
Does this discord require a phone number to be linked to the joining account? That may help avoid that.
Bloody hell . I suck at all these trivia thingy
hal Same haha I was late though
Scriptors mean botters like they use bots to spam in chat
how these guys without messages get the first places
guys hope that the admins will be able to check unusual activities some of these guys are replying way too fast
LMAO i dint even see the answer then all react already
i have no clue lol but ik for sure that on mobile its more laggy and i think youre able to react before the answers showed cause the bot was very slow
congrats to the whitelist winners!
wow man still up! what time is there? 
Doing that trivia on mobile discord had me in a headlock KEKW
Damn questions didnt even load..
Congrats yall how is everyone so smart 
It wasnt unusual activity quizzes lag on mobile
someone got negative numberspepethink
That killed my phone on mobile lol
that trivia was going too fastl lool
BouncyBear jeez got 251 but i got 810 right only problem was since im on mobile right now 200 reactions would come in before i could see the answer options and to add onto that there would be a 35 sec delay to be reacting due to the speed of mobile being so slow
yeah that lag on mobile is a killer! it was loading slow even on my laptop!
I see bro thanks for the explanation !
U need good connection to do well in quiz
same here. how can they choose before the answers were up? yobatman its 11.12pm here. where u from bro?
CONGRADCHEWLAYSHUNS on the new WLs!! PESHeart
umm usually they just spam the same thing and dont reply to anyone if you reply to them ahha so make sure to check their message history if they actually interact with people first
will do! even though there are scripters the trivia quizes are still lots of fun i shoulda studied more..
LoL. Sometimes I wasnt getting the options only . I saw numbers going up I pressed
I still havent seen any WL winners from the trivia here
they were lagging on my desktop too
i think the best method for quizes would be for actually people to type the answer in slow mode and then the mods would pause the chat and look thru the history to see who got it right
I dunnu man The last question so late come out and already 300 voted
Congrats to everyone who won the trivia. yll are just too fast
yeah I literally prepared and everything too the questions just threw me off.
philippines bro! haha yea idk bro we might need a faster wifi for it 
are new members joining this channel required to have a valid phone number linked to their account? Could help prevent bots  spammers.
some questions were late.... and the vote went already up... plz 20 winners... or 15 winners
Bro so many new faces here welcome guys
does my log look like spam to you  o
I know the answer but the option dint come out on time lmao but Im still lose anyway I wrong 34 question 
malem boss. Holymoly  Legend same for me. does ur internet speed matter during the quiz?
BouncyBear im not sure how people were answering before the questions popped up im assuming they just have very good internet.
Its okay mate well still make it! 
yea better to have a wall of text lag rather than rng choose the correct vote 5050
still prefer my good old giveaways haha
120. wompwomp... Congrats to those who won the quiz! May need to try connecting to the modem. Answers werent populating for me until there were already 520 votes on the correct answer.
i would love this too aPESCryLaptop
BouncyBear dunnu   but maybe a yes?
yo whats good bro good to see you here again
Oof do you have a gaming laptop or a mac that your on?
i think people were blindly guessing
facts the answers were great too even tho some of them were misspelled  
was a fun quiz anyways thank you to the mods and admins for hosting it 
Yea lets get back to conversation. Haha
yea. there were already hundreds of inputs before i can even see the choices and pick
im on a simple ol chromebook that siezes up if i try to go into decentraland lmao
Bro youve been strong for hours green name is incoming for you!
hmm i can assure you that all mods and devs are 2fa and are secured but for normal members this would be hard to implement because not everyone may have a cellphone number
Whats good yall these quizes are too hard 
you had to pick the correct answer b4 options popped lol
I think some ppl were answering beforehand before the choices are revealed
are all chats have 1 minute cd?  haha
My partner did the quiz she loved it well done again team
yoyo sorry took more than a couple hours xdd
hal GBMM Heck yeah but I love it here!!
BouncyBear I know same happened to me i was very disappointed. On a side note going to do some bloodwork! Yay!
RIP me. Missed the quiz because the boss needed to chat at exactly that moment.
I have a sick laptop but I had the same thing. Ill just connect direct next time and hope to do better.
yeah it doesnt really feel like im grinding more like asserting myself in a community
But thats super lucky to be able to guess 13 consistently probably they had some API to see the qns as they come in
Not complaining here. Probably a discord or bot issue the question choices didnt show up until mad late. 
Learned my lesson to use a computer next time sheesh
Thats cool that you guys all have 2FA though! I have seen some discords require it and it has helped the botting. not sure how many people dont have a phone number these days though...good thought. id be curious to know!
cool man is is a fund experience of trivia ! THANKS I would like to join more !
Not really tho.... i switch over to the more stable connection
Actually the quiz bot wun take those answers if the actual choices are not revealed yet
morning cave 2 hows everyone doing
Dachshundwizard  Twitch  your fanart is one of the best one Ive seen!
not much we can do about it lets just move on and enjoy the community 
kennayyy  yeah i forgot to mention that on mobile its kinda of laggy cause the past quiz on mobile everything was delayed
The first day I grinded but now I feel like I can just chill and enjoy the sommunith
i was too slow and it was a bit laggy. but i think that was the case for everyone. so only fair wins i think
Who got their butt kicked? Is this the loser cave now?
Morning! Did you miss the trivia quiz?
Just did the trivia despite knowing some of the answers its not easy hitting the corresponding button! Hahahaha
ill let the admins know about this suggestion tho thank you 
aint no cap in my game. dam bro ur grey thats crazy to me
Yeah was using mobile and was laggy.Will try laptop next time!
Ryu how often do the quizzes come up?

It was when choices came up. Guess its due to high response
congrats on getting the WL from trivia man! you definitely graduated the top class of wyvernology
Yea unfortunately X this is crazy but at least we tried 
My fault man i meant in general having a lan is faster

You will if you sleep again HAHAHAH
the pfp color question one is lagging for me hahahahaa so i decided to follow the crowd and got it wrong
has anyone played the new AoE yet?
Grats to the winners of the quiz
how did you end up doing that? Because when I have two monitors connected it makes the hdmi port one connect to the amd integrated graphics and the usbc port goes straight to the gpu.
going to join here for a bit the other chat is moving bc of the quiz ahah
did you get the Portuguese one right?
Always another chance mate dont give up
I did have some lag on the quiz tho sometimes the multiple choice answers dont show up. But in the end it was still fun 
congratz everyone... i got 12th... better luck next time  if it just werent the 9th question glitching..

Souhate yeah top def has some fast fingers for sure quickest reacts ever

Ooh Ive never heard of them are they good?
Thats it brother! Do the work get rewarded
That question was mad hard bro i was like whutttttt
yup came out yesterday if im not mistaken.
People actually tried botting??
dude im Portuguese and i answered wrong laugh
Does anyone have any info about the tokenization aspect?
They get taken out straight away
yeah haahahahaha some of the latest question is really  lagging for me tho sadness
Hey guys the quiz got leaked and some people tried botting it.
I have checked the chat log of every single top 10 winners and only 2 of them will receive WL
WPY and IMXAPE congrats! To the rest  NGMI
Yea i think its in the faqs or roadmap
looking like its gonna be a 1 hour wait for blood work so im back BouncyBear
today i hit 3 foam runners. 2 red 1 orche. what about you? POLO  WHAT????
Haha I am with my parents rn so Im waiting on them to leave 
Congrats to you guys!!  man hopefully can win the next one! haha
dont thnink too much of the trivia guys plenty more to come around think of this one as a feel for it 
wow the quiz got leaked thats insane!!!!
Oh my.. Time to check it out. But nft takes up all my time..
ill be up for the next 72 hours
Glad to see youre still grinding
Thanks for the quick turnaround! Hope that the remaining spots can be raffled to those who play fairly 
haha. thats quite a while. welcome back!
NFTs down bad right now in general. might be a good time to try it out
BouncyBear lol yeah thats what happens when you have to do bloodwork asap and its a nightmare trying to make appointments
does server boosters have benefits?? or just changed color names? haha 
nice. i can do better but my proxies like shit
Boosters only changed color names haha
Hey im glad we were right on our suspicion! Incredible that 810 were bots.
Yep!  How are you doing though?
I never left bro. Here since the beginning of time. Haha
wow congrats to those two! ahh that sucks that we have bots here but what can we doo
i am looking out for myself by staying in the top 200 
so far just change in color names haha well 2 lucky member got whitelist randomly but thats it
how did the quizz even get leaked?
cool name and one night they did a random giveaway to the boosters so you never know man 
I messed up on one instance sadly
wow the team giving back towards the community instead of cheaters  
bojangles  no clue it sounds crazy huh lol
wow thats a lot of winners gone
u have to do it a certain hospital or lab? usually we have many labs here that can do bloodwork so if one is busy just go over to another
probably some bozos glad team double checked and disqualified them tho 
Love to see it! Climb up those ranks
Nice work mods on checking for botters
support my suggestion for a fashion channel!
there really is a ton of WL spots available. thats crazy
That would go hard but then Id just get flexed on 
I feel you bro ngl but sleep is so important I found that out early this week
Mann is it reallly possible? how?
i slept good last night at least D
Just came back from work. Just staying in chat for a while. Then will head to shower and dinner
thats a good question. im not sure what to call it
BouncyBear no i dont but where i live this is the only one that isnt a 45 minute drive with traffic and if i drove out i would still have to wait a fair amount there so its just a nightmare overall
Kindly give us an update when investigation completes. Really hoping for a fair game
Wow man how did you find out it sounds serious buddy! hope you have been taking care 
tutan is my friend i dont think he is botting tho. Let me ask him privately
surprised you guys figured out that it was botted in the first place. Good job and good luck. very authentic
hahha thats crazy good detective work
ah that sucks. well an hour will pass by quick when u are chatting here i guess! haha.
Yea man . Thats the plan. You are still here as well. Gona be glorious day to be in green together
going to the doctor right now AMA wyverns
Everything is possible with bots.. Also know of bots that will auto help u enter all giveaways
Unreal! As long as youre getting it in that is the main thing!
top 100 lowkey could be all bots who knows? i managed to get top 115 with the answers barely popping up half the time feel like we need a better system all around
yea saw that haha i thought there will be  some kind of giveaways for booster   haha just speculating
i know plenty of mods who leak this kind of thing to get their friends wl its really common
Well more spots for us I guess 
Yes sir well get there any moment now
Im looking for whether its fixed supply total supply and burn rate. Im in another project I thought was going for an aggressive burn rate to keep pace w a kongz model would require burn of 18002100 tokensnew part of project then the dev said something about it only being 250 tokens to mint the next part and I was like hmmm. That said they havent said what the supply will be so Ill remain hopeful that the math checks out. I guess I figured it would be something most projects would have outlined in the roadmap. With the current supply on this it could be one of two models Im just trying to figure out which one it is.
my ganesh and whatbot worked well today but i have alot of declined. cant check out
Hope we can get some fair giveaways 
who knows  guess well wait on that answer
yeah a lot of declines today but the sauce is there
Thats some allegation there buddy
I tot the quiz is prepare by mod themselves?
Kishu wow good catch guys makes sense though based on how fast answers were coming in before the question popped up. The staff here continues to impress me!
at least they are checking authenticity
I really think give aways are fair no way for outsiders to manipulate the bots to force a win
how else would it get leaked lmao im not even blaming anyone in particular
ayee we will all get flexed on hahaha
Yeah just that trivia was iffy 
yep and they always check the winner
Not sure too but im hoping there will be some investigation proper
ay everyone who been in here having good convos will get wl eventually. quiz just a fun way. no worries everyone
wow! odds in booster gang lmao haha
best part about the team wanna give everyone a fair chance
So sad some mods are leaking the quiz
i saw someone hit 466 doubles with velox. unbelievable
BouncyBear very true time flies in here. Especially in thecave2 where real conversation can take place.
ayo we getting flexed on at the moment by the green lads
everyone welcome morchize he is shy ! Morchize
i enjoyed that anime kuroko the shadoww and carryy PESHeart
should be someone leak or smtg i dunnu rpf
its ok we all have a great opportunity to hit green!
Wonder if there will be Cave wars 
I thought it was just me using wifi but my ping is still sub 10 ms. lol
almost top 100 lfg ill be able to sleep tonight
no worries will able to be all green when theres hundreds of whitelist spots to go around 
King Kro we are all equal we come together as one 
I must say I am very disappointed that there arent any green WL named active in the community right now I wish there were more.
2 channels are really brazy man! haha   is this really this wild during est bois are up? 
true that! i gotta bounce tho. its already 11.30pm here. haha. need to sleep. got work tomorrow! have a good day man! hope everything works out on that bloodowork!
hes being a nutjob and is typing like he wants to get banned
I only read comic books. Watching movies takes a lot of time
dis coo w me giveaway that wl spot 
ofc but the thought was just funny lol
Kishu  wow thats crazy too bad peeps like that here
for sure! appreciating the team for providing many opportunities PESHeart
i mean alot of the greens been grinding so they probably just taking a quick break
i knew someone that somehow used to play a ton of video games read books and watched movies. like how???
i dont even wanna go to the gym lool i dont wanna lose my spot
BouncyBear thank you so much i hope you have a restful night! Enjoy work tomorrow and maybe we can talk more text time we are both free!
Man how about the orange names wish they were more active as well 
i guess so LOL Faudi what you think about this
Greens come and go but like any projects they disappear after getting WL
Good morning Wyvern fam!! Hope everyone is enjoying their Friday so far!!
I used to hit almost 200 pairs of yzy 350 but it was a brick
for sure! was nice chatting with u!
time to switch to this cave since i detected a weirdo in cave one
Wow. Thanks for the transparency. This bodes well for community building. 
Brausoto  it drops quick when not active
Cheaters are really good nowadays
i am hoping they will announce little by little
Good morning Peter ! is almost 1am now gotta sleep soon 
yea but this dude also worked a 95 lol. seemed impossible
dw cant get banned for stating an opinion
dont let this take priority bro! about to start a workout myself i guess you could message during ur intervalsthinking 
i mean idk dont take the chance.
i know bro thats why i donr wanna leave
Hyxder  a weirdo how what done to think this?
yo guys time to sleep whattttt why sleep at all see you guys soon love yall
now the weirdo is in here so i will transfer back to first cave
maybe ill make it with a top 70 
Yup....like every few hours just be up in cave 2 like Oprah
Oh wow they actually caught some cheaters in the trivia. Good job mods! And congrats to all the new winners!  
We are already part of this cosmic venture!
I love how transparent the team is in actually scrutinising the fairness of the winners
how do we know top 20 are not bots tho
Wow almost 1am. What part of the world are you from fam? Yeah bed time soon. lol
hahaha he probably did it while at work
oooo some drama with the quiz fun fun fun
the mods check chat logs so it should be all good they all seem very competent
botting is really bad these days. i bought ganesh for 5300 and now only 1400 left. lost nearly 1 Eth 
Lolol. Have fun running through channels. I hope you find peace 
anyone else very hungry? lets hear some favorite foods!
absolutely im yet to see a team as dedicated at growing an organic community as this one
PekingCow  ARKIPEL  you gonna rest?
gotta pull out the pop corn for this one 
yup no bots here. organic growth only
hey guys soon when we announce random quizzes we wont be giving a  10 min waiting period to avoid people from letting their bot accounts join instead it will be a quick 23 min starting time for only those who are active in chat to see and join
HAHAHHAHAHA best plot twist ever
They are ensuring that real humans putting in real work will truly be rewarded
from Malaysia bro gotta sleep soon ! G9 and see u tmr 
Long way to go. Same goes for me too
Bought Kage for 4k sold for 100 
wow! wowza  since when you discovered this server boss? 
Love that its not an invitefest to get the WL 
I respect that Ryu love what you guys do to make this as organic as possible
Great is an understatement at this stage
Ryu Sweet! Ill say it again the wyvern team continues to impress me!
Howdy fam!! Up to anything my man?
i mean in the quiz haha im rank 118 or so tho
how are you not whitelisted yet?! I thought for youre you would be! Kishu Ryu monitor this guy I dont see many people having consistent meaningful conversations! hes been here since the start too
Will this happen at all timezones?
kage is trash lol. I am so sorry for you
Love it rewarding those who are active in chat!
I second that. Seems like they have a rota for mods too. Constantly online to modulate and regulate. Great organisation and discipline
Hope they do a lot of contests 
Oh nice!! Alright fam have a good night. See you later!!
Im feel honoured to be part of such a project destined for greatness art is one thing but the team is what makes the project successful
YuppI have the same opinion there are no spam bots and invitation contests here.

Omg its about time fr congratulations man welldeserved kinglove

caleb I think the quiz was made by someone in the community and they leaked it out to the public beforehand.
Botherr you got it!!! Well deserved
youve been active you deserve it
WOW bro this blows my mind that its even physically possible. Truly pushing the frontiers of digital art
Ahh that would make much more sense sorry for the misinformation
Sweet!! Im loving the red wyvern. These leaks are getting better every time. Appreciate you!!

good luck getting wl soon. ur under 100 u should be in wl in no time!
Yeah hope they get it sorted out and let the legit winners have the WL
v1 congrats man ive seen you very active its great to see the mods continuing to provide!
Faudi gave me newfound motivation by calling me a bot so i gapped him by 10k exp. he has now given up
That sneak peak as pfp is insane
hes gotta keep the love fest with faudi going somehow. lmao.
I want to be whitelisted so bad! I play ARK just to ride wyverns lol
was he joking or unironically calling you a bot hahaha
nice pfp and nice dub boss!!  would love to have BAYC also in the near future! goals! 
guys  5.7k members with 2k online how genuine can this get !
congrats to the one got whitelisted!
for some reason he was unironically calling me one like my message history aint right there funniest part is whatever he says makes no sense bruh 
its incredible bro so glad to be a part of this community
I think he was joking tbh. Its still funny to watch them go back and forth tho
ay congrats to the legit quiz winnrrs

Dayum bear.....legit beating the bots. GOAT
right? I like how they do their due diligence

wassup caleb. i woke up and saw whitelist at 198 and freaked out. but realized its open to 3000 now. duh should have remembered their announcement xD im glad now though

OMG that sounds so good right now haha 
oh what alpha discord you have boss?  if its okay to shill it to me haha 
What is the advantage of server booster?
hinata bad asf especially in that one movie
pink name brings more ppl to server and the warm and fuzzies
Hey good morning AP!! Hope your Friday is going great so far Fam!
nothing so far but it helps the server. Right now i dont think it worth anything because already full

Someone has used my fan art entry in their own as a gif what should I do ? Be flattered or complain ??
sorry to budge in but fried oreos from like a fair hit bro u gotta try with the powdered sugar on top and all
coming over to cave 2 i feel like chat is more organic over here
yea just been enjoying this community the past few days
Is hard to compete here for 200 WL spots only!
2003000 for the WL still got time
i see but you are a rich one coz u have kongz   haha
top 200 is definitely very tough
if they did not ask I might be irritated but ultimately it could be flattering depending on how you look at it lol
sneakpeek bro I need this  Will trade my PSA 10 for it 
I almost guarantee you it is people probably bot in 1 and dont take the time to bot in 2 
bro sugar makes me want to die pensiv

You should report them to the mods
Morchize shit just made me laugh lol
Id shoot a message to the person using it if you wanted them to stop no need in involving mods imo

I need a green check rn else wont be sleeping today
Congrats to everyone who got wl
Slinqy  what up g i saw you here yesterday
This fire is only growing bigger
u gotta get some rest ser health is wealth
they have big plans for the future and the fact that its growing this much without invite contests is crazy
im still trying to buy a damn Etholvant what about you?
shit i should teach my dog that if thats the case
Bro when they showed BEWD I literally said I need Charizard and here they are teasing me with one haha
Very low supply and incredible demand this is going places
most of mine are just youtube channel discords. they usually have people in their talking and stuff
Thats probably the nicest way to do it
only 3500 wyvern right? I guess we will get around 1 mint per wallet
whats up my dude! Glad to see youre still in here as well
Love the moderation on the quiz! 
sending luck to u and everyone on that WL PeepoHeart
yes but 200 are for top 200 rank
Xp is for a minute or for a message?
yeah im hopeful. A couple mods noticed me yesterday and I have been getting tagged left and right through people responding and having dope convos with me. haha ima be patient
sitting in vc with friends. grinding homework here
yes ser i believe the remaining 500 is for giveaways and stuff like that
3450 50 is for the team special event
you think they gonna have a role beyond OG where we get to mint two of them?
Oh I saw that I dont even know what it is. Lol. Heard its something good though. How many are you trying to get?
not much bro just watching some ultimate frisbee reruns from last week
but there will be more chances so dont lose hope bro
do you have any reco youtube channels that i can watch brother? 
Yes you gain between 1020 xp per kinute when youre messaging
Im so used to slow mode since Ive got into the NFT space that now when I see a Discord server without it Im shocked LOL
hal Thats awesome GL with homework 
Man top 200 isnt too bad right? O.o
team is super cool too promising some good utility. definitely a hold job
For sure very excited for the future.
minse096 Yep only 1 mint per wallet.

Yeah 100  time management is like soooo important. Its like my biggest struggle
i woke up 2 hours ago where the mods based out of?
I bought my first one in august of this year  been loving the experience since
this seems like an  uphill battel
i had to go to rehab after they removed the travis scott burger. I had a crippling addiction to it and needed help recovering
are you in college or out of college right now?
LOLOL oh im having cream cheese. HAHA i could see where that would sound like that my badddd lol
oh my god  thats too competitive LOL
Hahahaha nah im actually having this Japanese takeaway which is different for me
me too i am spending all of my time on discord
100 percent just been busy engaging in here
Lets go! Staten Island repoin here bro the forgotten borough. The apex dumpsite of dumpsites
Morchize  sometimes I feel lije a cat
I see a lot of people asking its 1 mint per address guys!
it felt like space apes hahaha and i missed it.  Dont want to missed wyvern too
Cant manage todo anything else  lool
ahh thats a lot better i have some leftover curry so i might make some udon or rice to go with it
Havent gone to college yet but if I did Id be a Sophomore. I had a lot of health issues that set me back  but the good thing is is that Im in the NFT and crypto world in the meantime 
staten islands pretty emptyy but im inluv with the houses there
do you like cosmic wyverns as well?
When you guys think crpto will crash again?
awesome man .. nice place to hang haha
i perfer sparkling water like buble
like is an understatement.. we LOVE
yea it was like AA but tbh ive never tried anything more addicting than a travis scott burger
yep Im 99 sure I remember rightly!
It depends where but its pretty suburbanlike everywhere. I like how quiet it is here
yup! it only make sense if we got 1 mint per address for 3000 supply. Imagine the unique holder would be like. crazy
I won a photoshop contest just now yay!!!
lol wait for the next negative news in the crypto space. Every news right now is kinda postive
Yea man...jus hav fun..forget abt the xps..u will get wl
same do you know how rare it is to enforce full pre sale and to only allow 1 per mint lol
oo i was at staten island for the first time a week ago
nah bro when i got the bts meal i could literally smell jimin on it. thats true addiction
Congrats bro! What was the art like? Show me in fanartor here
understandable. one door closes and another one opens!
Defnitely !! like the environment here !

did u go to staten island mall or something
Thanks bro I would love to but it shills another project  only posting Wyverns around here hahahahahaa
yeah the 500 supply  is reserved by the dev right. I imagine we will get 2.7 to 3k unique holder at the first time before people then selling and some people will sweep a lot
glad to see. u here still enjoying convo w us bro
Thats alright youll get back there sometime again
wad did u do at staten island? Think
super excited to see what they implement

burgers are just wide and are dry as hell but cant lie the fries from bk hit pretty well
Henry!!! Congrats on WL man didnt even notice

Ooh youre lucky as hell had shake shack like 2x but i live on the west coast and we have in n out but like its overrated imo the fries are terrible and the burger is like any other burger
Bruh slow mode in the cave is brutal
gn all! time for bed. keep the grind goinggg
Nice congrats on the WL Im sure we will all be blessed at some point
We all up next in cave 2! This is the best channel! 
thats the spirit! May the spirit of the ancient wyvern bless us
I dont have to grind I just go help new people and congratulate those who get WL. then relax everyone in the general chat channel
that happens..leader board is super volatile
Slow mode is okay because without slowmode everything is gonna be a chaos
it dont matter to me brother. im here for the community. came for the whitelist stayed for the people. yk what i mean?
i liked innout when i tried it had the mustard grilled or whatever its called and well done fries. i do have a soft spot for smash burgers tho im ngl
steveo is legit too wyvern lords reroll for him
yeah i hear you fam good thing is people are close on levels in top 200 so its easier to overtake too take advantage
its necessary bro if we consider the hype
yeah thats the best kinds of servers haha
Thats the only right way! Keep it up 
Dont want to lose my position. Cant sleep lol
you should try to bet on sweepstakes today brother haha you might win the grand prize! 
big facts though !! staying strong here as well PeepoHeart
I almost didnt sleep last night Im glad I feel like I still have a chance at top 200
yeah gotta be careful. people constantly taking each others jobs
Morchize I cant it will take time away from here
man would 100 offer a better safety net
this will be great once it launches
wow just read the annoucements about getting wl through top 200. the lvls at which they are is crazy 
aye i see you put in a good word for me  
u guyz saw flur lurking in cave 1 dont know if he is real
true that. mac fries get soggy easily
probably but maybe u can only leave it for like 10 hours and then need to get in again
Way too valuable to risk a spot
oh jeez i almost dookied my pants. Never trust a fart after eating mcdonalds
Gus needs a green name and bad tbh kekw
uh oh its about to get real mainstream
fahui  yeah and if you get there better stay ys never know when snap shot will be yaken

dang eth is in price discovery mode today
Bigger whales are slowly gonna start joining in go ham while you can
sounds stressful not sure if i can handle going for that   i guess ill hope that ill win some giveaway or get it by being helpful to other ppl.
Never haha I was actually kinda interested because i wanted to see the quality of the food
jq nah im from cali but i travel a little bit sometimes
A while is nothing ofr greatness
hahah ill see you guys at the top!
ETh on a whole nother level lol
me too never tried but really curious about the quality and taste haha   are you from DC?
Feels like it ahhaha been crazy
yeah i heard beast burgers were pretty great. shame that having to have it delivered and not eaten fresh probably lowers the quality
man bad time to be overinvested into jpegs lol
zackemc  marsfahui  yes helping people and  being positive get wl faster than grinding..lol
Oh hey what anime is your default picture from? I watch some anime but not too many  O
Im from cali but i travel a little bit Ive tried a lot of good spots but i need to hit more local spots ahaha

Now we can see the tally of total wl membersavailable wl
ive been discord grinding for months now im basically 88 years old

everyone make sure to keep watch of whitelistinfo and announcements !!
ikr you really have to stand out haha

i know i dont feel alone at all when i chat here
Bruh you have us were all friends here
how many times can you even play this game
going to go grab lunch see ya ladies and gents
chilling with the Wyvies and eating food
no need to feel alone when you got literally thousands of people to chat with
the game was designed to determine who was the most cringe and thusly who would most likely have a secret dungeon under their house hahahahahaha
That is the beauty of genuine organic communities everyone helping each other out and just chilling together.
Hell yea everyone just helping each other without question
Thank you so much that would help
facts thought everyone here is so supportivePeepoHeart
Man this community growing too fast cave 1 is moving too quick 
who else gotta be in there though MonkaHmm
How nice this world will be if everyone is like that
Henryy you still here dude? Since the last time I left you?  Or did you take a small break and come back to it?
Hopefully everyone is doing well
hows everyone doing so far today?
They just want to create polemic they are going to damage the NFT market thing
Haha i took a lunch break at work and now im back!! And answer is Ryu  Wojak Jack MaskByte green!
yes i think i saw flur join in too. which is bullish IF its actually him and not an impersonator
hhaha i see np brother! haha man! really good to know some filipinos out there and here grinding!  like that mindset brother! haha hopefully can visit Cali in the near future 
Do we know the details about how Mark intends to introduce NFTs to its audience?

Bro is it green Im gonna cry at the bank I have to wait a minute to send another message
whats up man! glad to see familiar face. how long you been on here today?
brother the whitelistinfo channel makes it seem like as soon as were in the top 200 on the leaderboard we can get whitelisted is that true or are you still doing the snapshot thing?
sry fam got tied up with some work. yeah theyre pretty cool. I just dont know what the utility is for holding them. haha.
dammit I had my slowmode enabled PepeHands
been here a few minutes I gotta go out soon tho
its quite hard to have a convo here
charizard vibes with the new sneak peak tho
yeah that delayed my answer by a moment hahahaha
i have decided to keep charizard as my pfp till mint day
is hard to reach the top200 mod should do it top 400500 at least
check out some of the other channels bro! sports pets food a lot of them are easy to chat in!!!
I suck at art so thank God everyone said the answer hahaha
Some cities and parts of the US have a lot of Filipinos hahaha in the bay area we have a lot of Filipino people so im always around the culture
I like to watch series more than movie meeting friends and playing sports!
word word im headed to work now so im just messaging while driving tbh lol
thanks for the encouragement PeepoHeart  we luv u guise party oii
ayo stay off your phone while driving
Gus congrats gus!! So happy for you man

Yo my guy thats really not safe..  I know you want the green but we can chat when youre somewhere safe and chilling!
you know how to speak tagalog or not anymore? haha 
BRO I wanna type all caps tysm!!!
Glad to see you on here again but stay safe man while driving
im going to go whoop some ass in pickleball ill be back grinders
and the timer is a minute hahaha i guess its necessary because of the level system
I like action like prison break and squid games but also enjoy comedies like how i met ur mother
ayo multitask brotha!! haha i know its unsafe im driving w my knee tbh 
Muiz caleb haha i know appreciate the love
Yeah if the timer isnt a minute the amount of spammers well have in this chat is insane! And it would go even higher the more people join so.
lol join us in chill chat. main chat is almost always for memes and sweet nothings 
Thanks man youll get there soon I can feel it
im from the U.S. where are  u from ?
Cool xD its moon time there I guess??
Im chilling becoz still a lot of spot ! We def gonna make it 
I worked with Wyverns for 8 hours straight and I made it to the top 30
you deserve it my friend Gus . and thanks for the support my man
A preview of the Wyvern game in Alpha stage right now which you can find in roadmap. FULL utilities have yet to be announced too please get in while you can you wont regret it. 
naaaah i can understand a bit of it and know some of the very basic phrases   do you know more than two languages?
 yall are getting creative with these meme
wyverns are quite known for their commitment to the cause
did you guys speak another lenguage?
cant wait to see more of the game
i agree but hopefully once the leveling competition is over we would slow down and be able to talk properly
game is going to be sick tbh very eager
i speak many. which language do u wana talk in?
squid games! i like it too haha. Have you watched alice in borderland? quite similar survival theme
Slow mode on should make it decently readable
Whats everyone planning next???
i ben there many times i like it a lot
wow!! nice work brother that is crazy high!
Wow and you dont have a green name
hey syd how are you doing? did you even sleep
I honestly think you need to get used to this timer because the more people join its about to get even more hectic in here.  So best if we consider this as our normal talking speed! What you can do is in the 1 minute check out any other channels that pique your interest for example Anime or Crypto or Sports and then message there and then come back here and chat a bit and bounce around. Thatll help keep your attention and you can have more fun as well!
Bro I still cant believe it keep going everyone youll get there
its like diablo graphics!! i would love to play this game man!! 
i think a  was typing those message 
waaat!!!! how are u still not green?
wow crazy how long have u been grinding
I have been down to New Mexico but never been over into Mexico I would like to come see it sometime though!
was gonna go to cancun at some point
never been out of the US anyone else ?
haha nah just 2 haha hopefully can learn a 3rd language and be fluent to it but it will be hard haha i think spanish would be cool   since its close to our ancestors hahah
hahah my assumption is that its because people are tryna level hence the number of messages ive seen some servers with slower chats despite the size because there isnt a level competition.. but ah well i might just try the raffles
you do look good in green my brother
Why is my name still white X need some colour paint  here
Haha well deserved it man you always active in here haha
Whats everyone having for lunch
yup settle in for the long haul lol
theres a lot of beautiful places we have beaches forest jungles its such a beautiful place to visit
Right now its because of the level system sure! But imagine when we have 30000 people in here in a couple of daysweeks then we need the timer even if there isnt a challenge so we can consider this practice for that time as well!
Because this community is so interesting Im very interested in it
Aomine  Aron  I dont know but maybe Ill get it soon
PltrBagHolder  Ive been grinding for 2 days
love the dedication! hope u get green name soon 
keep at it man. you will get it soon. i feel it in my guts
no but i plan to heard its good which do you prefer
green coming soon everyone ! stay active lets all get it
anyone got any idea what food to eat today
Sad haha but im almost 999 sure you will get it
Ooh yeah spanish is a good one i took four years of it in highschool. A lot of the words are similar to words used in tagalog. Right now Im learning Japanese Ive been learning more about the literature like writing in hiragana katakana kanji etc.
watching TV smoking this medical trying to think of where I want to order a pizza from atm hahahahahaha
Hahaha thanks well all get there
Aomine youre next man I can feel it
Aron 0xCharlyOP zackemc AirWolf thanks everyone! Keep going
did someone know what is grind?
So really the dream routine right now! Hahah. Chilling pizza smoking all good. Nice.
thinking that rn actually mad hungry
might get pizza too then how do ya like your pizza
i love both but it got different flavor to it i think. Squid Game is more.. realistic and Alice in Borderland is more on the science fiction side
wow!! man thats really good! so you are into manga also right?  haha are you fluent in spanish now or not anymore? haha
chilling with the wyvies how u doing??
Gus ayee level 15 here too rank 67
Aomine  PltrBagHolder   Thank you I hope you do too 
Aron  Thank you I believe in it so do you. Keep it up
Doing good man. Chilling at work.
I tend to order pepperoni black olive and sausage pizzas but I think I am in the mood for an alfredo pizza today
i love sushi its a great idea for
I love how professional de mods are here
yeah i think they both have their quirks Squid Game is a more believable premise while Alice is a more indepth premise
Dear Fam I will bid goodnight and hope to be able to do better tomorrow. All the best everyone!
Much love for the team and staff 
probably all of them. Apparently theres massive interest in a role like that
Goodnight Pat dude! See you tomorrow!
yeah the mods are insane always online and working SO to them
enjoying my diner with you guys !
i know. they are all really good ppl
 Im still very new to learning Japanese but i have attempted to read in the original language. With spanish I was lucky to grow up in california and a lot of my friends speak spanish so i can hold conversations up to a certain point but Im not too good with literature hakekw
check announcements to avoid losing eth in a hack and educate yourself
looking on doordash rn actually cant tell what im in mood for
yeah squid game is something that can definitely happen in real life if some sicko super rich people decided to do it haha.
whos favourite color is green now that they are here lol
i usually get alfredo and chicken from papa johns
Brausoto whats your favorite sushi brother
morris ehhh both are kinda good
Green flags all over the place

Thanks hope to get it not even 1 hour in here almost lvl 4
sometimes popeyes  chip tho no?
dm me with your proof for the art
girl tacobell isnt real tacos you must try mexican ones theyre on a different level
Congratulations dude! The green suit you.  Are you new to the space perhaps? Asking out of curiosity!
this message should put me at lvl 14 hopefully
you use this  3 times and start and finish with it...  lol 
im supposed to make some instant noodle but now im ended up with a soju in my hand instead.. i wonder how that happen..
nah man. we get tacos of taco bell only here. i dont think i have seen that inn the menu
also there are ode meats and toppings for chip popeyes only got chicken
Keep it up bro youll deserve what youve done.
Remind me of Kaijus but I missed Kaijus and these are cool af so Im in. Also this timer is making having a conversation difficult lol
But u can have both so why worry 
i know you like chili sauces? i love them with red sauce
Ya we gonna try our best to collect it
ive tried mexican tacos before as well from a food truck !
popeyes is like 80 batter. too unhealthy
lets say you ate chip for a whole week would popeyes not taste amazing the 8th day
Thanks for the transparency team announcements stay cautious with all the scammers out there guys!
agree with everything you said here lmao
Honestly who is in FL and can cook I need some fire recipes
protein is protein man i love chicken meat
If i stop chatting i will drop 200 places unfortunately haha
go get one for yourself bro.you deserve a break
word record some clips for us man im sure the rain would make slander 10x better
Its not too bad in here a lot easier imo to hold a convo than cave 1
not too bad honestly like i said just got to work and just chatting w yall
thats why i prefer chipotle !! PepeHappy
Scumbag I was talking to you yesterday! Congrats man you got green
i mean yeah if u eat chipotle everyday you gonna have diminishing returns. obviously youll want it less and less
you have to go to a mexican place
BRuhhh i got OG roleee haha thank you ser admin ser mod aeveryoneee thank youu
But still a lot of places open so i hope to get wl i think we are still early rn
thats where all the good tacos at
Hahaha thanks I might listen to you
I wish there was a good mexican near me but the closest is tack bell sadly
I also missed Kaijus! They are a great project actually. I dont know if Wyverns will be like them at release but I for sure am holding my Wyverns because I like the roadmap and every piece of content that weve seen yet.
U fw the smoked brisket from chipotle? Whats your order there usually? i need the sauce
we dont have many in india. but sure will keep that in mind to try one
congrats to u !!! and sending luck to everyone else PeepoHeart
no chipotle is so good that itll take 132.54 days for it to start its diminishing value clearly proving your statement to be false
caleb had their smoked brisket yesterday lmao
nah man just been having random headaches everyday. they come and go. just like how she did
caleb never tried the brisket. heard its mad good tho boutta try it
yea roadmap even better though roadmap
yomsssssssssssssssssssss for sure good luck to everyone !
Yeah I need to read into Wyverns a bit but hoping there will be a breedinghatching mechanism
I see you green as well! You deserve it 
dude theyre so sick tbh! we have crazy ass ones here that go like 7080 mph lol
I am sure that if not in the first phase but in future phases it should be possible something of the sort. The team looks good and I am sure it can be executed.
wow.... what did the doctor say tho
ooooh my bad i didnt know were you from here in mexico we have a lot of indian food places which dish you recommend me?
Smoked brisket is so good imo sucks that its for a limited time
heloo whats good ! is this general chat?
yes I just came to this space yesterday. But after finding this community very interesting I continued working on it.
Aron  I only slept a little yesterday but I have already dropped 30 ranks. As long as you work hard for it you will return to your rank very quickly. Even more
holy crap I had no idea they made them to go so fast that is badass
i dunno haha i think ive seen someone with the name steveo
Yeah Im optimistic. We shall see
said it might be migraines. he gave me a referral note for a neurologist. got an appointment tomorrow morning for that
i miss biking tbh i should buy a bike
yeah those are around like 5k but we have regular e bikes that are around 1200
Yoyo heard that this space is more chill
Lmao same i dropped 30 as i slept and woke up
Ik but Ive seen so much people disagree lol
second gen? theres like a genesis general chat ? hahaha
oof that sounds rough hopefully the neurologist got u tmr!
usually ppl like butter chicken and biryani away from india. so u may try them
Yeah i know will be a short night haha. But totally worth it for this project
Yooo these are sick af ever take one on the freeway? KEKW
Yikes. I broke mine on a trampoline lol
bruh im rank 467 do i keep going guys
No I mean how long youve been in the NFT space as a whole! 
good that they are aware of the hacks
nah meds are weak. i like to stay hard
I would love something like that just to run to the store on would be very enjoyable imo
if u personally find my shop yes i will give you one 
caleb personally no not yet but some of my buddies have
that is BIG YIKES atleast u recovered
of course! You are so early man and off to a good start
Maybe I worked 8 hours straight and now Im a bit tired. I have to sleep to stay healthy.

Im working right now did you finish work already?
I stay off all meds too except what the dispo gives me lol
yeah look up twitter stringify nft
Ah is there a top model and like a budget model? and what would be the difference between them if there is?
If its real u need medical attention
hey everyone. finally have a break at work
this is so random but my friend told me she once had roach antennas underneath her chin and she thought it was her hair.
Noo i dropped 30 ranks when i went to sleep lmaoo. Thats apart of the grind tho
absolutely with how many zip scooters I see around this has to be the natural progression
what time is it right now in ur place ser?
its all good bro. you just gotta climb out the mud
doing great guys just got off work now im chillin
How are u doing whats your rank now
Oh I thought you said you dropped 30 hours! Hahah. Honestly 30 ranks isnt that serious considering in a server almost 6500!
we have different motorcycles  which vary between street tires  all terrain. some have different sprockets to make them more torquey
nah im planning to go at least another 2 years like this im running at max efficiency
ohh okay did you recover completly? or you still have some damage
Damn kennayy my nigerian brother! Hope to see you turn green soon
Yeah its hard but we are still very early i think

Haha yep!! Do you live in the states?
Vibes  currently at work just ordered hibachi
Im doing great dude! I joined the server just today as well just a few hours ago really and having good fun chilling here. How did you find out about this project man?
i used to hit my keyboard sometimes when i played league 
Thank you im more excited of the soft shelled crab haha
damn  those portuguese egg tarts are supposed to be good
Yes I live in new york state not city
rubbish. same game every year and im SICK of it
Welp catch yall on the flip time to get some exp with my barber
my cat is not pleased with me not petting him lol
fifa is really great you can do a lot of things on the game
Happy aniversary hope you guys have a great time
I am in PA so not to far from you
Good fam at work just ordered some food.
Players doing something whole different than what you want to do in weekend league haha
oooo jjust went there 2 months ago to NJ
is the state expensive like nyc
what rank we got be to whitelist
I love NJ and NY wanna go back soon
 Farinasaur def has its ups n downs
1200! and the snap shot is taken randomly without anyone knowingf
Top 200 active people or you could just get handpicked from a mod
I like this chat more than the cave 1 chat
went to check ot American Dream Mall
we all making it happen in cave 2
im sure we have time just keep interacting with the fam and it should be good
oh sweet yeah ive been there before im liek 30 min from it actually haha
hey  peeps in cave 2 how r u guys doing?
i know snap shot could have been taken by now lol we wouldnt know
ooo dats nicee! I wish Hmart opened there when I was there I wonder if its opened yet PepeHappy
I really hope it hasnt im almost at 200 and I was below it before
no not nearly. We have high taxes all over and were probably more expensive than most other states but NYC is its own separate animal and everything there is far more expensive than you would pay for it in other parts of the state
hello guys how yall doin today?
petting him has mildly satisfied him for now lolol
honestly not quite sure tbh been there only once
im sure theyd tell us when it was taken but i guess they could encourage activity by not telling us although i think thats a bit disingenuous
great man just chilling w the community
any lore about the cosmic wyverns any ideas anyone 
If you get whitelist here you dont have to pay 3 eth on secondary market
Sure you are not alone in this case
Same here bro! I have had some good conversations in here today!
eventually they will tell us but that could be any time!
its going to happen for you bro visualize the win! I can see your name in green in my mind rn!
ahh i see i would like to visit american dream mall again so spacious
indeed it could thats why im maintaining my spot
have faith man well get it too. We gotta keep going and stay positive
same  a lot of helpful ppl in here
absolutely massive for no reason haha its insane
we also got trivia quiz here??? things just got more interesting
i was ranked 27 earlier! woke up to 157 
Sol is good !! But just no good quality projects on it lately
scary for sure.. how long did u grind
i seen people carrying snowboards
Remember stay active and help others within the community and answer questions! You will be green in no time!
Damn this community is grinding whole day haha. You cant take a break
so far doing really just doing some work hbu?
yes yes there is a ski slope inside ! have you ever been snowboarding ?
Yeah weve been working hard here X
guyz posted some memes in memes
No set date atm! Just know they are watching everyone and choosing people !
no i rlly wanna try snowboarding one day tho
alright just got back home. lets have some fun wyverns
Unfortunately only 1 hour and 20 minutes in this server. If i knew earlier about this project i would be a higher level
Oh hell yea bro!!! If I can get one of these ill be doing the same with it too
everyone here is so kind i like this place
you def should at least try ! tons of fun but very hard
Bro honestly were all still very early! So be at ease and just chill and have fun here.
dont worry mate there are still chances I believe dont give up yet
I would love to see an indoor ski resort I have to go to the mountains if I want to do any skiing lol
its great! you should try having conversations with others lots of interesting people in here
ohhh definitely  kaiju 2.0 with only WL people
Yeah still 2700 spots left so i think i still have a high chance
I agree 100 with you on that one man.. This maybe even better
yes I hate NYC but Im actually going there tomorrow to visit my wifes sister
ggwp ive been grinding since 27th around noon CST lol. clocked in some good hours into this chat. level 14 almost
nice bro i hope you have a good weekend
ayo youre eating some good good food can I get some of those? haha
the mountains are by far much better honestly real powder over anything
We all have a high chance! For everyone who are active in this server were all going to easily get it!  So be relax man and just chill.
good to hear skiing is legit my favorite sport I wish I lived in the rockies lol
yo tummysalumi can you drive me to queens
Im about to head back down for thanksgiving i cant wait to go back
Yeah but this community is so active this is something else ahaha
i gotta be glued to my computer here
yea this community is awesome i enjoy my time in here
A monumental figure to this world
Im fine with visiting NYC for a day or two but I would absolutely loathe living there
same it has been what I have wanted to do since the pandy began I think this year I am going regardless I had a buddy who went this year and said the lines were nonexistent
i went during covid and it was awesome not many people on mountains
Hahah active genuine community is one of the best signs.
i see! need to be here then haha dont want to miss it
i thought u wasnt coming to slander boi
im heading to bed guys! getting too late here haha! GN!
boy if this chick selling 25 tickets of course im comin wtf
Yeah floor of this project will be so high
see that sounds pretty awesome it sounds bad but the fewer the better on the mountain lol
yep lol we all trynna secure the spot. though the ones getting WLd now within the top 200 will drop slowly as theres less incentive to grind. so it should in theory get easier but your also fighting with new people too
thats awesome bro keep doing it like that
We need to get that wl spot for this one!! Im rooting for you bro 
Hey man nice punk! Is it yours?
as people get wl in the top 200 the snapshot might end up bringing people below the top 200 in as well though
Hahah dont think about the floor honestly! Think about the true genuine path of the project and the future and the advantages you can gain from holding it! Diamond handing it! Because a great project will always rise in value and if anyone sells early theyll regret it for sure. So hold!
minse! u still up hahah! gn! i just woke up so might as well get some conversation going here 
SunnyDoonji with the pace right now i feel like we will get to 10k15k in one week from now lol maybe less
i told someone earlier i was catching up on school work earlier but ive been chatting for an hr lol
doing good man. plan to make my own noodles from scratch this weekend for pasta so kinda excited to grab my ingredients tomorrow
Yeah this will be a blue chip for suree
thanks man  we are gonna make it 
oooh nothing beats homemade pasta fr
lmaooo time rlly flies by quick chatting here its like 9 hrs so farfor me
bro i dont care if its not floor if i got a girl goin with me
we need rank 200 im lik 800 wtf
agreed I think this server is going to explode soon
Wow thats mad. No rest for the wicked wh? Where are you ranked now ??
If i get one it will be in Diamond hands
gotta keep going my guy this kind of thing doesnt usually come easy
yeah potentially! although its hard to get above a certain discord count that doesnt have a invite contest   people come in and see they are late and lose interest immediately. they are onto the next drop. which is good IMO cause the demand rn is totally there
anyone interested in ufc and watching fights this weekend ?
At the end of the day regardless the aim is to build this a long lasting healthy community. No point for building for the hype only
Yea man we got plenty of time we got this!!!
i love noodles share the recipe 
man what the hell what about us
no I grew up about 90 miles north of NYC
haha yeah but since we still at 2303000 whitelist i think that too will attract more people. I think there will be more competition other than top 200? well find out soon i guess
i know you would leave the boys for a girl too stop the cap
Yeah already a lot of people without invite contest
What does this fancy role mean man? 
it means that they r OG role they arrive here early
man at 5am last night we were at 5k members now were at 6100insanity
Love the SVS bro! Did you get a bat as well?
idk dude doesnt really look like you are interacting with people and you keep blurting out random things. sorry if im wrong though!
I am so happy there is no invite contest with a low mint count its unnecessary and brings paperhands to the project imo
gonna be my first time making it hope it turns out good lmao. wanna try making gnocci next too
I grew up in the city so all of my friends are there
Nicee goodluck for last minutes
biggly facts though growing by every second as we are typing rn eyess
there will be lots of opportunities. art contests meme contests quizzes. best bet is to just talk in chat though! and watch the numbers rise
So there are two OG roles one orange and one cyan. Whats the difference between them?
i live in India  ive been there  wanna give it another visit soon
i love the genuine growth as well 
jq  best if luck dude ! hood it turns out well
One is whitelist other one seems different
Awesome man!! I would love to come see it over there someday!
Yep! Maybe check out some of the other channels you can really have genuine conversations with others and its no where near as fast as the cave channels.
just got off actually! about to order some food
Hahaha yes ofcourse but like what is the reason behind having two different OG roles that is what was curious!
One was for the first who joined the server the other idk
understandable then. I have my sister in law there and thats about it.
yeah the organic growth is awesome
Oh man order me some too please.....
oh its better than before but still there is ome  but people have started  doing their normal things

Gator69  sadly i didnt get in jF coz i just didnt pay much attention to it that moment 
its true it doesnt get the love it deserves
nah i live in the UK would love to go though
I had a feeling it was going to be big but i think this is going to be even bigger!!
Whos gridning for the next few days 
Lets try and invite all our friends and family
nahhhh.. Im from US but I like Indian food
meee. Im canceling all my plans to grind lol
man those takis will set my ass on fire lmao
look up either chicken tikka masala butter chicken and garlic naan. anything biryani is good too
everyone  this is a great project to be apart of
yeah its very famous and delicious
I am from us too what state you in?
yeah man its could really be a blue chip no kizzzy
ooo ya i like that hint of lime flavor
yo. i love indian food. chicken tikka masala with chana masala is the bomb. i also love their chili chicken that is def the best
great recommendations chickpea curry be hitting too
you should try it man! i swear its amazing. they have such flavorful dishes
Oh yea dude I believe so too. Man i hope we can get that top 200 activity spot!!!
Doing great man tryna get that green name like everyone haha
i will screenshot all the names hahaha
Dont only focus on top 200 just talk and be nice. Mods will notice
  this projects potential is amazing
i am. youll see the same faces over and over again
im hip bro its all good appreciate the lookout
never had chana masala but will give that a try. also never tried chili chicken so also giving that a try.. im ordering indian food tonight lmao
caleb chickpea curry is also pretty bonkers. i love meat but that stuff bangs out with flavor i dont even need the meat
ya bro go for it. the chili chicken is so damn good. you should try out paneer tikka masala too. paneer is their cottage cheese
i already have that top 200 activity spot ....  i have grinded like 16hours i think. im rank 130 right now
I am on the other side of the country PA
Hey everyone! Back with the best fam
nice i lived in Philly for 6 months as an infant and thats all the PA experience i have
Nah dont worry about rank man! Just have GENUINE conversations with people and mods will notice that. 100
Solana seems tk be driven by nft sales to a greater extent than eh
chana masala is just chick peas with the sauce. youve never had chickpeas? they so damn good. should try out aloo rajma too. thats potatoes
Welcome back homie how are things going today
havent really dove into any solana projects
Oh man that is awesome. What do you have to do now? Just hold that spot until they take a screenshot or something?
CONGRATULLATIONSSS on the WL!!! right after ur twin HENRY got it too earlier before PeepoHeart
yeah i am  the market is pretty down rn i thouhgt of buying a solpunk and holding it im not sure anymore
about to reach level 8! Slowly but surely man
when you are genuine everything come behind it
what wallet do u use for SOL nfts?
sol projects are popping off need to get in those
HENRYYY yooooo good job on green my mannn. i heard the other henry got it today too. good stuff to you two. well deserved.
thank you!! I know right i was so happy for him and now i get to join him. Ill see you soon over here as well 
I have been to philly a few times I live by pitt. I never been to cali but man I would love to one day
I use phantom too best I have found so far
APDaytrader  phantom...are there others?? im dumb hahah
sending out love and a prayer to all yall who are going through difficultchallenging times remember that this too shall pass. May you find your way to freedom prosperity and peace. Dont forget to be kind to yourself learn the lessons and empower yourself.  Beating yourself down doesnt serve you or anyone around you. Take a moment and put your hand on your heart and tell yourself that you are doing your best and you are enough. really feel the words in this message  Virtual Hugs  stay blessed because you already are. WAGMI
Take care biggest part of SOL projects in past 2 weeks fumbledfailed and now are under mint.
I have stayed away from sol completely. Still dont have enough confidence on sol yet
no phantom seems to be the common one. i just havent stepped in to SOL nfts so was curious
i use phantom. Very easy to use
Looks like everything on sol bricks super weird
phantom is good. its actually better than MM imo
solanart magic eden digitaleyez
most of them are copy paste from eth
thanks man hope you make it too
Aomine sol was popping like 23 weeks ago any nft was able to reach like floor above mint
SOL transaction fees are cheap for sure but you must take care with failed transactions because you will pay that fee every time you try to complete a tx
so far so good just finished doing some work hbu?
a lot of rug in sol nft so pls be careful
I havent heard of any good sol proyect in these days tho
grubbing down on a sandwich watching the new Walker w wifey and its meh lol
Oh yeah Ive had chickpeas! Think thats the same thing as the Chickpea Curry right? Im more used to having my chickpeas in form of Hummus though lmao. Taking notes about aloo Rajma and chili chicken as well
I dont like their market place at all. Maybe coinbase will change that
Not a copy paste but arent well detailed roadmaps arent good. Its very clear that people are there for the easy money  flip only. Today I lost 2 SOLs in a project I trusted and it even went OOS.
Cave 2 always thriving I love it
Phantom is awesome works well with my SOL Sniper i made
Nice keep it up damp 1 min thing seem abit annoying 
for sure!!! sending luck to everyone here PeepoHeart
Lol I wish I could help ya out there lol
yeah there was also some sol squid which rug pulled
Hahaha try to enjoy it! And if not youre here with this amazing community
Are we getting thru and out of the caves soon ?
yeah sol project are so risky rn lol everything bricks so quick
agreed but i think SOL is the best alternative to ETH better thann AVAX and ADA
Ofc but still some nice protects on sol
its funny but I get more actual conversation in here not sure why the difference lol
ah i din know that. thanks for the tip!
Eth is just overpowered atm. Which can be good as well
1 min slow is good imo because its less chaotic haha
Meerkats and Cyber Frogs were a good example I made a bag with those.
whats the difference between cave 1 and 2?  
Glad to see you green bro! Told you we were gonna make it
its like hidden in plain sight most spammers and such get distracted by the first cave
no difference just lots of people
Man you are still here. You are crazy
Dont have difference just to split a bit
yup. chana masala is just chickpea curry i believe. i know a lot of this because i actually work at an indian restaurant lol
Im doing really great just finished doing some work 
Yoooo you made it! I knew we would both thrive together 
Yeah but i love cave 2 a little bit more haha
yo! nice level up green looks good on ya 
since crypto is popping nfts are dropping
Aomine it would definitely bring some big changes
Farinasaur  i minted meerkat but flipped for 7 sol i was still early in the space missed like 33 more sol but we move
maybe a little high. 500700 range would be good
o wow you made it Gus congrats man
yea thats right to cater the influx of members 
samesies i been in cave 2 for most of the time
when I find a campsite I never pick the one right up at the entrance you have to get in the back to cave 2
Love that there are multiple caves
I believe in the code and the statement as well as the creators of SOL the next best id say is Polygon
Yeah true In a way but the conversation isnt continuous because we have to wait for the answers 
I meant on trying to figure out what you had to do to turn green haha. Was just joking around
Same man. Less messages much better
Hahaha I see what you did there
love all the caves sometimes this one is just more chill
haha that would be cool marketing that cave 2 is better chill spot that cave 1 
hahaha  i think the pink just blends in here somehow xD
its alright haha because without slowmode we cant find our conversations haha
Facts guys im just playing ya dig
cant comment on it never heard of it before but ill check it out!
this is the first day of the rest of your Wyvern lives lets make it count and keep this community growing not by jut numbers but by diversity and a common love for the Wyvern lifestyle! We are family!
I love the concept but wonder about what happens when eth 2 launches
Love it! Youre all family forever
ill prob be pretty obsolete its more like a temporary solution until eth2.0 launches
we dont know when it will launch
It really is lol. I went over there for a few and couldnt get a good convo going so came back in here to stay lol
IMX is pretty neat. no gas fees. but the UI still need alot of improvement
I dont like the 1 min cooldown but its understandable
All of yall gonna become my family haha
Thats a good positive looking doodle
welcome back to cave 2 ! PeepoHeart
yea man! haha chats too crazy in cave1 hahah
lmao true that if history is any guide the timeframe w get pushed back again
Oh damn makes more sense now lol. Do you ever get sick of the food?
Be safe and wear your mask yall
we all gona be real family in nov!
ofc. i get sick of anything i eat too much of. always gotta mix it up and have variety
already 6.5k one hour age we were 6k !
We dont have to wear a mask here
have patience bro we will reach there
Sheesh 10k by end of the weekend
can vibe and breath at the same time
yeah the growth is insane cant believe it
Way true thats why I cant stick to diets that much lmao
Not much just chilling with the fam here and you
and its all organic. thats the best part about it
legit no crappy 10 invite whitelist contests or the like just pure engagement
usually when i diet I keep calorie count in a deficit if im cutting and making sure i just eat generally healthy food
im good too been chilling here with the Wyvies ! PESHeart
Just be active and you will get it for sure
grind doesnt matter genuine convos matter
green FTW praying to see it pop up soon
We are part of something special here my man 
goodluck to u and sending my luck to everyone else in here PeepoHeart
I put in a few hours last night and about another 4 or so today so far in till the wheels fall off
Yea it is a huge reward once you finally get that wl spot!!
ayy sweet im trying to start chilling in here more when i can between work all day
Itll feel so good to get that white list no capppp
Yeah I feel you calorie counting really is the most consistent and efficient way to go. Not one focused diet beats it from what Ive experienced. But yeah Im just a foodie at heart cant help it at times lmao
Ayee rank 141 how is everyone doing!
Heck yea it will!!! Ill be shaking if i turn green lol
Listening to your body and your body will inform you how to eat weve forgotten how to listen
same i really enjoy snacking alot and i just cant handle weighing every single oz. of my food
agreed I try to just focus on conversation and it stays fun. Just cant force anything
Everyone make sure to follow the Twitter page officiallinks
Id piss my pants if i go green 
good stuff bro you straight chillin
congratss on being top 200 !!! our inspiration PeepoHeart
Yeah I think estimating calories takes skill too and a lot of getting used to. I think Im fine though Im not too unhealthy in any way so diet is more of a personal thing for me.
LMAO me too!! We will get eventually you just have to stay positive and keep chatting
Just woke up and now need to grind lol
Pal thats  A solid rank. Bring me with you
Discord life is an honest day at work 
177 for me been a good day party
Yessir hella people join today. Were almost at 7k
ahaha moderation is everything as long as its under the calorie count your good shrug  I chose to do intermittent fasting along side a calorie deficit and lost like 20lbs in 3 months. plus with intermittent fasting i ate less meals a day so 12 decent size meals were good for me
we getting to 10k by end of the weekend
I feel the great vibes coming from yall
ya i bought a food scale and i used it for one day and then i nvr used it again it takes efforttt
Yeah make it hard to get WL now sigh
Easily its looking that way kennayyy Im at 230 wait for me
this whole server is good vibes its great
nah man you just gotta put in the work. hard work is easy work
Im Rank 370  its hard to balance work and chatting on discord
It really is hahaha! My wife thinks I am playing on the computer when I do this but she will be happy when she sees how much they are worth  when im holding one lol
makes complete sense do the best you can!
Maybe even more without an invite contest Insane
yea but u just gotta stay consistent with it
its hard to do anything but type in an activity comp lol
what are some hobbies you guys have
Do it for the community! And its not all about the levels just be in here for the community
Oh never tried intermittent fasting but its been suggested to me quite a few times many do say its really effective in controlling food intake

Angelmisa  games like valorant etc?
Nice! I live in Oklahoma how about you?

How long has everyone been in here chatting??

Ive been here for a little while I work from home so I jump around talking to ppl

Now that you say that I think we may have already talked in here earlier lol. I live in PA
Good to have you part of the family

Oh yeah hahahaha absolutely! We are lucky in this state there are almost zero restrictions we actually got constitutional carry this year one of the few things our governor has done right hahahahaha
r6. im v good at it i love it. you should defo get but its dying down slowly. Still love playing might go on rn!
today is for sure a great day with the Wyvies PESHeart
Ayee scumbag congrats on your wl!
whats your favorite cods? no specific order but MW2BO3BO2 are my top 3
Oh nice!! So you guys can carry without a CC permit? WV does that too I know.
The crypto space has been taking up my time its tough but I have a real interest in it
Asham Nice man that game is massive but ive never managed to pick it up. I dont love those sort of tactical shooter games i bet it requires hella patience. ill be down though after a few games of apex  where abouts are you from man?
No specific but CoD4 MW2 BO2. Most hrs put in probs MW3 however aha or BO3
goodluck on the next giveaways guys !
whats benefit for being server booster ?
I only have BO3 in my top because its more of a memorable game that i played with the homies but other than that i would probably put WAW over it
cave is good brother. nice breeze in here
just a nice thing to do innit might be some more benefits later
yep we can carry concealed or in the open w no license now its crazy and you would think people would be wearing them everywhere in the open but not much has changed lol. Everyone was already carrying them I think hahahaha
yeah BO3 multiplayer was real enjoyable for me. WAW probs the only CoD of the older ones I missed but I respect its influence
i like it realistic games win for me what about you what do u play
man hopefully we can win this one!! 
I feel this I have changed my life around and became a blockchain dev and it has been a great experience so far getting into blockchaincrypto
visualize the win folks see your name in green in your minds
what do u get usually? any fade or taper?
ur the homie. same to you wagmi
basically booster get utilites as well right ?
good good hold it down in here wthug
whats going on guys?? hows tiur friday
how does one even begin as a blockchain dev? sounds super interesting
yeah you can change your pfp on this server
i lost faith in sol projects. had a few bad experiences. i also dont see any projects go up past its first week high other than degen apes or sol punks
Lol! Thats is awesome! I have my permit for here but it would be nice to not need to go through the hassle of getting it...
may yall eggs hatcchhhhh wpirate
2 winners oh no...My luck is brutal
I was going to take the classes when they passed the law and now I get to save my money. I know how to shoot well so I didnt need a proficiency course lol
not really worth it for me not rich bro
 one of us in this chat will get it 
I started by learning from Ivan from Ivan on tech. It was like 1300 or something for his full blockchain course and he goes from blockchain to crpyto to NFTs to learning to code to TA. It seems like a lot of money at first but the skills he teaches have provided me with much higher returns
Last giveaway a guy won 2 times out of 900 entries
make sure to check giveaways yall!!
WTF 6600 members? it was 6100 an hr ago 
Yea same here on not needing classes. They dont even make us take them here its optional but you have to go to the courthouse and get your permit. I grew up in the country so I had one on my side when i was a young teen lol
8 more minutes! may the odds be in your favor
thinking its gonna grow to 8k today party
wow ill definitely check it out that seems super informative for that price I would hope anyway . Thank you!

I think open fermentation is a lambic style fermentation where you leave the beer in an open room to gather bacteria whereas barrel aged beers get the flavor of the oak and whatnot. Are you from Michigan? They have Schramms...Michigan has a lot of good mead

They both are insanely good at what they do no?

yooo TheWalrus057 congrats man you made it!! hope i can join you sooner or later
congrats!!! thats awesome to see someone from cave 2 getting green 
Whats our hottest take when it comes to crypto?   lets hear it
love seing people turn green..... except when they are about to be sick
Awesome man!!! Congrats well deserved!
oh wow that was like 24 hrs ago lol  strong communities is the move rn 
hey man doing good how about yourself! i like your bitz 
same man well get it soon offwhite
Damn man thats so littleI usually try to get at least 56
do you have a local session beer fav?
Gn to you guys!  might take  a rest and continue the grind later  keep safe to all of you guys 3
Mods have their eyes everywhere it seems 
Thank you everyone I really appreciate everyones kind words I am not going anywhere you can get used to seeing me kicking around in here!!!
bullish into november. Were gonna see eth at 6k soon
you should check out KrakenZ messages he seems like a bot wink wink 
good night see you tomorrow hopefully
To diversify channel and reduce traffic lod
probably! unfortunately thats bearish for NFTs 
Had many quality conversations with you the short time Ive been here! Well deserved brother
Yeah I was too scared I was going to lose ranking man hopefully I can get ahead so I can get clonger tonight
yea man easily this over the get 515 invites  level to 5 for wl projects
Because we cant fit in one haha
yea its so nice when ETH goes up when I have liquidity but when for NFTs its so bad
Impressive.. I just woke up 6.30am and ths first thing I thought about was the Wyverns . Keep going.. YAGMI
oooh i see. two caves are timers are still so long!!
i dont drink a ton of sessions but i like Post Ride Snack from Maine Beer Co and Super Session from Lawsons!
Unfortunately nothing is easy X
so we could have conversations otherwise the chat logs will b way tooo fast
Because one would be so full I think
Same bro. I didnt get the wl in kaiju
You too brother you are going to make it I cant wait until you are green!!!
Anyone here agrees that MJ is the goat ?
its ok this is next MOON project
if ETH goes to 810k then thats gonna be really bad for all NFTs... mint prices will have to drop significantly
How long have you been here? I joined today Im level 7 ish
Bro the latest rises are hurting the market as well
Mooning is an understatement. We are here for the long run buddy. Welcome!
that kaiju riddle thing was so stupid i like the wl process better
awesome ill have to check those out.
please check fanart somebody stole art and took credits as if he did it by himself
yea I agree some projects rn have wayy to high mint prices for the current state of ETH pricing. I think this project is doing it perfectly with the 0.05 mint price tho
I bet those could get distro near you! i know MBCO distros but idk how far
nfts wil go to 0 unless eth 2.0 drops
Good stuff man about 13 hours I would say rank about 210
yea but i feel like i could have been more active in kaiju and hve been noticed learned a lot from that project
yes he forsure is a big influence that shaped the game how it is today. Plus watching games was mesmerizing
felix.collector  yo man you have some explaining to do he stole art
Wow.. Good work DX.. Easy here to level as its a great community and chat is more about getting to know people and sharing interesting ideas
welcome back home !!! PeepoHeart
Nice!! Just finished work myself too
really nice art in the fan art page well done
gnight blessings on your titles
Oh thats ggs then keep up the work Im getting closer every minute  I really hope I get it D
thanks! Of course haha I add here and now. I really like the sideway action the last couple of months. Once this breakout people will wish they bought under 30
i desperately need some food in my stomach rn im starving lmao
same brother im about to eat leftover stuffed peppers
yeah i know ive been anticipating that for a while now.. didnt think it would get this bad though. 
Slinqy yeah mint prices need to stay low. Gas also is destroying this market. NFTs really are getting hit from all angles right now.
Souhate ETH needs to come out. it will resurrect this market
what topic are we on in cave 2? just came back from a small break
You will get there bro be consistent and you will be there in no time
He was just something else during his time. It was like watching someone dance whenever he played
get some food man gotta stay healthy !!
ooooo wyverns does trivia and raffles for WL?? i hope i win 
meee too i have to work on some dinner and will return to the cosmic cave asap
Anyone here believes in alien ?
lol guys check fanart  somebody tried to win with art he stole  disgusting lets get the mods attention to this so they can ban this guy
all these shitcoins pumping rn is making gas insane i just want the nft market to go back to normal
Yup and active members also get rewarded! keep grinding.
Yeah we worked hard for everything in life
LFG! hopefully can still catchup with you guys 
hey bro! i saw you got whitelisted earlier also congrats What art did he steal? ppl be so lame
peepolove 2 pepeLove 2 pepelove 2 pepelove 2 pepelove 2 pepelove peepoLove 2 
Just hang out in here and vibe out you will get it eventually
i believe they are out there since the universe is so big i dont believe in a lot of the videos circulating around
get some sleep if you need to man!
Time to hopefully enjoy the weekend
Yes but i think at least it worst
he stole something form kaiju discord and added his name thats so lame man
resting is important bro a quick nap would make u some good
yeah these pupcoins are not helping the issue. NFTs will have a rise again but its a tough space to get into cause the price keeps going higher.. NFTs may be bumping during the bear market though! we shall see
im gonna grill up some chicken in a minute actually
What are you looking at this morning  if you have any time outside of Wyverns
Congratulations. Saw your chats in crypto. May you HODL the wyvern with all your heart.
my bad i just got a lil confused reading chat ahah
jq what made me respect him even more was his documentary Last Dance
Of course the universe is so big. How about you?
Would u guys take 1k per month for the rest of ur life or take 10 mil rn?
Sounds good bro any marinade on that?
First of all congratss on your WL you deserve it and in fanart  he got exposed for stealing art
no just some salt pepper and cajun seasoning good sir
i dont believe in aliens do  u ?
nice how long did that take you?
welcome back bro how was work? or are you just chilling rn?
lmao i love you! Thank you so much. LONG LIVE Wyvern!!
THank you Bot Dylan APDaytrader IMXApe GUH777 BearX Morchize
10 mill and i would use it all to buy matic
congrats mann!!! yeah that art stealing lame fr
They already deleted the art  nvm you cant see it now
10mil right now for sure! Especially since the same amount  of money loses value overtime if this makes sense lmao
I have some errands but cant pull myself away from here 
would you guys take a millionairy advice or 100 bucks?
this! so many nft phishing scammers nowadays.
Dang and just when it getting juicy hahahahaha
13 hours bro now I need to hold it just stick around and vibe you will be fine
hahah i did that my first day here! try getting to 15..
Of course... So many suns out there  its. inevitABLE
i would take 10mil rn and be settled for life pepeLove
Anybody have cool plans for the weekend?
May it be as green as my portfolio.
Dr.Gino Never underestimate people! what a shame...
good for you bro takes a bit but its so worth it!
Haha interesting proposition. Ill tske the millionaire advice cos 100 is not life changing
got busy at work so now just chillin here bsck on discord making it impossible to rank up
100 bucks cause im a bag chaser   KEKW
yo congrats kyle! I was talking to u in crypto earlier
Did you check often your rank ?
Thats not good. Glad it was removed
haha amen i wish it true. congrats on the green
the advice is to take the 100 bucks
Good stuff man!! Grats on the green
yep! 100 in crypto though ahha. what do you invest in?
man thats so messed up someone stole art?
for sure our chat has been hyped since the beginning PeepoHeart
Thanks! love holding down the crypto channel...good convos with smart people!
Yeah so worth it bro I wanted this project more then anything so dumped the rest haha
What u guys think of nets? Should Kyrie take the vaccine ?
There is a crypto channel WHY DIDNT YOU TELL AGH
i think he should stand his ground
   youre living everyones dream
yeah man. But I think they handled it
I know my focus is only on this project man it has so much potential
glad you got it man well deserved 
Oh shiz almost 7k! Growing super fast
I feel it we should be good though. we got in pretty early and have people to talk to now in the caves 
he better. the NHL had a guy falsify his vax records. he may never play again lol
no lol u just lost the chance to get 100 bucks
ya defintelly better than other discord where people just spam
just stay consistent and have good conversations theres plenty of spots to go around
i mean it doesnt matter anyways cause the nets arent gonna win still
I literally could talk days about crypto
I have been trying to make a meme for the past two hours I am terrible at it hahahaha
Nobody doing anything good this weekend?
i like cave 2 better than 1 chat is alot more peaceful
plenty of spots still open just have meaningful conversations and be helpful to others in the community and you will get your spot
Temp is dropping winter is coming and with it a lot of snow 
hes one of my favourite players!
Exactly drop everything for it or you might regret it later that is my attitude
Yall got Halloween costumes tho

Kayd i agree way easier to hold conversations nice to meet u btw how are you doing todaynight?

I think that would be pretty foolish and seems unlikely given the organic nature of the community
Around 10 eth but doesnt matter! All diamond hands here
not today but probably by sunday
hell yeah with only 300 left go ima say 8k !!
curry gonna end up being like harden right now just saying no cap no hate
Curry ahsnt scored in the 4th for last 4 games but hes still the goat for 3pointerd
right anytime of the day i can just make one in 5 mins and be good for a couple hours
I might actually start reading Dune since I liked the movie a lot. Might even rewatch it at some point since I had to watch it while preoccupied with Discord LOL
facts we got this!! all organic we got this
or sunday  who knows we are growing rapidly even as we are typing rn pepeLove
If curry wanna be the best pg of all time he needs to do more in 4th quarter
My search seems to have stopped working  anyone else having same ??

Mostly into personal development or business books! Syd Rogers My friend mentioned 1984 Impolite Ill check it out!
Not sure but defo enjoy the process and wll come to yiu naturally. We are witness a community birth
he needs to learn from westbrook similar to how kobe had to learn from michael
The power of one was a good read
But dont focus to much on reaching top 200 just be genuine and chat with each other
Oh yeah heard dune was a good book too
lol cant leave your computer for a sec in this server
you too man! you got this. i am almost at top 100 myself

We all know this get us deep in here for other reasons. 
I know I will never get WL in terms of activity is impossible for me. 
But still im herem trying to support the project that I like.
Great recommendation. I read that when i was younger
Percy Jackson was p good I read whole series in middlehigh school
i slept for 6 hrs and only dropped like 40 ranks
Its about a kid being raised in South Africa in the 30s pretty sad but powerful
You should peep three body problem! Fav book ever
love your pfp too did you mint?
I think its natural to have that aim initially.. but then chatting with people and meeting interesting people you kind of forget about the original goal  just great to be involved
if you help the community then you may get green name the mods are always watching us
its a kitty cat sadly projects been a bit hasnt picked up momentum but I like it   Ky nice lookin kaiju yourself
Nice whats that one about thoughty2 yes! It made a big impact in my life
What are you guys going to dress up as?

Only just started but already jealous of the Green

Tough at the top Tyler.. You managed to take any trips recently..? Probably not.. Whats on your bucket list ?

Westbrook would beat Curry in a 1v1
No not really only his first book. I watched mpre vidoes on uube

doing great how about yourself AlexisRawr22
In athletic ability sure in accuracy nah
yeah I watch a lot of youtube vids too. Project life mastery is a great channel!
im not talking basketball. Im talking about a literal fistfight. Westbrook would clamp Curry.
I think its because a lot of nft discords are getting hacked lately. so for security
Haha.. Bit of a fast food theme going on hey !?  Yeah I guess fast food is pretty scary right !
corm44  yomsssssssssssssssssssss Yep made loads of new friends  networking!

I hope one day i will win a Giveaway !

Yeah.. Im having a problem with Discord atm.. where it is saying that my mobile is assigned to another Discord account.. but if I enter with my mobile it takes me directly to this account.. Been on to support the last 4 or 5 days  pretty much telling me yeah thats strange ! Not so helpful !!
hopefully my name will turn green soon
the leaves are falling late this year in the mid east. peak color is a little late looks so nice in the mountains.
Then yess i drink lots of water
Cant say Im having that issue hopefully someone here has some tips for you!
Yeah once you catch with pokeball
anyone here ever played pokemongo before?
You dont need a gf once u cop a Wyvern
i briefly played it when it first came out years ago
I heard if you get a wyvern you can get as many gf as you want
Yeah I can see what its suggesting but Im obv. doing something wrong  Ive used it in the past.. Oh well forgot who I was going to check anyway
Can I have 4 at the same time on discord?
i did but i lost it when i was tryna transfer it from binance to bitvavo. but i rebought it a month ago
I did in a small way just for fun. Hit my sell early though 
just arrived at forest hills stadium
Im in Hokkaido Japan.. How about you ?
good morning how are you doing?
picking up a sausage and peppers sandwich
guys rmber they dont do flash mint here
Pork isnt for me bro pigs are weird
Good trying to wl but i think im too late for that
nah theres still plenty of opportunities you good
slowly getting there ! I believe in you vibrate
any plans to turn off slow mode or at least reduce the timer?
Not at all very few spots have been taken so far. Just keep staying active in the community and helping others when you can. You will be recognized in due time
I wish man would have converted it to eth today and gotten myself some Kaijuz

Hey Flem  Wyvern Ryu  Wyvern MAGNESIUM  Wyvern  i think offwhite is a bit sus he only sends one liner messages and doesnt react to s at all. mind checking his  logs to confirm he is or isnt a bot
whats everyone doing for halloween?

Where are you based  Yeah recommend it  Japan is awesome
someone come hang with me in pets  haha
Pretty sure a 1 min timer slows it down a lot haha but yea interact with the community more cosmicwyvern
i would love to visit to play  game arcades
Doing awesome how you doing arvin
Same for all  and it creates a much nicer vibe in the chat.. Its the way forward and will ensure that we all think a little harder about the projects we get involved with.. No public mint too so a chance and selecting mint time around reasonable gas fees
theres seems to be a lot of fun things to do! wgmi to japan ser
Brawlhalla and also playing valorant lol
i had no idea that was even a thing lol
Valorant is lit want rank are you?

still plenty of time and plenty of ways to earn a WL spot just stay active in the community
Yeah man theres a lot of stuff to work on for the game. Do you have anything in mind that you want to improve on? Such as jiggling. Strafing. Wide swing spraying or game sense?

Dr. CheekClapperan you been clapping cheeks?

Id like to check out South America. You been?
not as much after i graduated college i retired
I dont even bother checking my levels no point in stressing over it just build relationships through meaningful convos and the levels will come!
Yeah Ive spent a lot of time in South America
Anyone goin out for Halloween end
my project that someone was asking for
APDaytrader true that. hard not too sometimes tho
Oh yeah thats a big difference. Laptops usually only go up to like 60 fps. Mine is avg at 144 hz monitor. But that makes the biggest difference
Oh it was me haha you can send it by dm i want to see whats your project about
just posted. I hate shilling to randos tho cus i feel like everything just looks like spam
How many of you in here are parents?
Im not good enough to teach like that haha. You just have to play more to get better. Ive been playing since beta. But you got this dude! I believe in your capabilities fam
Where would you recommend? Love to go eat some Argentinian steak 
Yea i had a laptop that was 60hz for 5 years and then switched to a 240hz beast pc. biggest difference a person can see haha
do you play with friends or play solo?
that rs3 so clean my b for the late response I was taking a small break
But i used gaming laptop bro but the monitor wide is kinda small compared to the computer monitor
I want to learn how to clap cheeks
just get ur hands and hit them together ezpz
caleb no worries man take as long as you need for real. gets tiring for the brain
hey i think i have seen you around before. whats up
yeah im always lurking around here somewhere lol
Facts everybody here is chill af
Somewhere with great food and landscapes preferably
Mate.. the steaks in Argentina are unreal.. Id recommend the whole lot.. but Colombia Peru Argentina and Brazil probably the standouts for me.. Arg and Bra difficult though because they are huge
IYKYK Clean thats your homies right? The one who fills we85?
240 hz is a fking beast of a monitor yo. Im so jealous haha
granthempeake i play with a group but we are all the same rank. We started from the bottom together. If we played solo we wouldve gotten to diamond already lol
AbsoluteZer0 you can build a budget pc. Mine is like mid tier and i payed 1k for it during covid prices. Its worth it!
Syd Rogers yes love too. bout to buy a ticket for ultra miami
ive never been to south america cryingpepe
dammit.. will be hard to get WL here
If I Colombian food food will I get sick
Right.. Ive learnt from past mistakes.. time to make some breakfast
thanks  managed to snag myself a 3080 on retail could have sold it for x3 price if i wanted to but built my pc instead 
not even there are over 2600 spots left for WL. Just hang out and talk to people and see what happens!
fully built? She looks like a beast
lol yea me too. I will be spending the weekend in here trying to get on that wl
Soon bro if i have a time i will im focusing on NfT bro
Work hard and get rewarded yar pepeexcited
What are you making for breakfast
correct fully built. FBO  motor built by Iroz
Good idea happy eating stay hydrated
Yeah looking forward to these.. You into MtM too ?
Almost 7 k guys we growing fast
yeah i minted 5. I would sweep some off the floor if gas werent so crazy rn
Nice GL Gator I know you will put your time and and have a blast doing it.
Yea we are!! Going to be 10k before the weekends over
its going good Harry how are you doin
I think soloq is easier than squads. Since soloq people usually get matched up with solo q people. A double stack is the best way to play the game imo. Only because you have a friend to play with.
Taut was it worth it to hold onto your gpu?
AbsoluteZer0 i feel that brotha. Focus on the grind!! Games can always come later. But remember to organize your time because it is too precious to be thrown around
Haha.. trust a Dad with the good advice  If you want to brush up on your Dad jokes you can check out jokes channel 
same. they said end of nov for characters to drop. definitely some of my favorite art rn
Yup its been 200250 the last 3 days
Yeah bro i playing games when iam feeling bored
GabrielWyverns yeah bro focus on my goal
yes it was I never regretted it. There were so many problems with my preorder that it took ages for it to come and I held off building my pc for half a year cause of I heard news of the new 3000 series coming
dad jokes are the worst because you know theyre the best haha
Yeah nice.. I found the project a day too late.. it literally took weeks to get 1200 minted and then I caught it the next day when it had sold out.. But Ive got a couple of sets and some !rares.. so pretty happy
Yes mate just be a helpful one . And shrely when time comes youll be WL here
Im a father as well to 3 little ones.
always will somehow get a chuckle out of you lol
thats sick. its funny cus the project sat for a whole month then out of nowhere just minted out hella fast
Yeah.. gas is a killer right now.. Im surprised thins havent dropped even more cos its difficult to sweep the floor right now
kennayyy It got to the point where ive waited for over a year to get my new pc I wasnt going to sell my gpu to hold it off even longer
Just checked out their page  crazy af all their cars push
is been like for a week! thanks to Shiba???
Yea man the gas needs to go down! I havent been minting much at all lately.
my friday has been great! how has your friday been going?
Thanks bro really appreciate you you too bro keep doing good things.
Oh.. nice work  youre about to hit Level 14
I work a 95 so i relieve myself by playing valorant on the weekends. Its a nice break to have imo. I grind for everything else on the weekdays but weekends are for me myself and i. I feel like everyone needs a reset like how the rock resets everyday by going to the gym i reset my own different way
Taut couldve waited a little bit longer and got a 3090 haha but no i feel you. I chose my 2060 super because i didnt want to wait for the 30 series lmfao
alright guys i think i gotta bounce for a little but it was good ttalking to everyone!
oh absolutely nuts tbh. they know what theyre doing
If you are new to the caves be sure to check out announcements for WL info and go support your fellow Wyverns in fanart
Yes bro i just hang around here and do some helping to others hehe
good yomssss! just got off work so now im talking to you guys
i wish i was an artist the fan art is amazing
ooo welcomeback to Wyverns world !! PeepoHeart
Yeah I missed the mint by a couple of hours 
hello! hopefullly work was great
Haha nice I bet your busy! I have two boys ages 4 and 6
it was good! very chill cause its friday haha
so many talented people on here making absolute fire. i love it.
my friends this is the best channel
Nice good ages! Yeah we have two sets of twins  
halloweekend baby! what are everyones plans?
Yea my original goal was to get a 3090 I actually could have but thinking it through it is waste. No game or even Cpu can maximize the 3080 currently and the money I save from choosing 3080 over 3090 i could use that to buy the 4000 series when it arrives. That way I get the best pc currently and the best in future for the price of a 3090 which i cant even use to its max atm.
Wow that really cool you guys had twins both times but wow I bet thats a handful lol
Yeah I dont know if there is an official explanation.. Ive hear Shiba mentioned and Coinbase too.. just wish it could reset back to the normal high prices
Yeah bro if youre mood is not good just play games or chat with your friends just do the things that will make you happy. You know that
GabrielWyverns yeah bro helping people is always the best
Netflix and chill....? Horror movies are great for a date
what r u planning to do for the weekend?
It is for the first year then they look after themselves  Im done though no more
MessagetoMartians.. seems very interesting.. expecting some things to be moving on this one in the next week or so
doing well mate  smoking you know haha
hope all the moms and dads have a great Halloween with the kids this year. Hopefully everyone can find ways to enjoy trick or treating
lmao I bet!! I am done with the 2 I have. Where you from man?
Its a great day sir how about your day?
Yoo Ky wassup! I played league from middle school to high school. Got to plat within 10 rank games lmfao. And only played around 200 wins worth of games. I watch a lot of streamers to understand their playstyle and such ig thats how i learn
Taut what games do you play fam?
AbsoluteZer0 thats why valorant is perfect for me. Cus i love trolling people with my friends to relieve stress. Its something i enjoy doing to connect with my boys
Yes mate absolutely zero hahaha  helping is a nice way of showing how you love people around you
Im Aussie my wife in Japanese we live in Japan. And you?
The sun is shining the bills are paid my crypto is pumping life is good. Hope all is well on your end
doin good brother stay inside so cold outside
alot of my friends switched to valorant cause league was just too mentally draining
That is awesome man!! Im in the USA.
I havent played games in forever. Use to do some csgo rust. osrs with my old laptop. Tried out some new games when i got this pc too like dark souls cyberpunk. bdo
Lmfao I feel that every trend in life gets recycled its so funny how vine got murked and now tiktok is one of the biggest platforms in the world
Aye whaddup cave 2! How is everyone?
Hahahahaha smoking for anti stress. Thats nice bro but dont smoke many youll get sick ok?
valorant is really fun i just cant play it while im at college cuz my ping is way too bad
Nice where in the us? Ive only been to salt lake really
gonna purchase candies to give out as treats for halloween
I envy you lol..... Im up in PA
Nostalgia tells me vine was really good but I think tiktok is better
This is one of those projects that makes you feel like you have to be a part 
Vines were too short and its crazy how tiktok algorithm makes people so addicted
Aye thanks homie!! I been trying to catch h up to you fam 
what are your halloween costumes?
kennayyy But I dont play games anymore nor do i enjoy them really. nothing that interests me atm. Waiting for these new crypto games to respark my gaming attitude.
Yes mate just chill help and relax and to the moon it is
Yeah games is also a stress reliever youre right my friend.
GabrielWyverns are you pointing on to me lol angryjoy ... yeah bro so lets spread love
dont worry i left faudi in the dust so you can take his spot
tik tok is much more developed  then vine ever was
Yo for real I just took out the garbage and didnt realize man
I live in Pennsylvania by Pittsburg
Ahhh I love Florida so much cheap state
Yeah lets hope that is the whey 
Im comin for it  what you been up to bro?
Hahaha thats nice let us spread love and affection
It is! I dont even understand how to jungle anymore and that was my main. They always try to add new things to it making it more and more complicated every year. Its so ed i think thats why i mainly stopped
Slinqy i always wish i could do more in learning how to code too. Thats my aspirations but i feel like my mindset should come first in case of any burnouts
Taut yoo osrs is my shit still is! Havent played in a bit because of life but i love that game. What level is your account?
Thats the vibe haha lets go mate
Oh cool man hows the weather there atm?
been tryna get wl for this other project i like but dont really have the energy anymore Kek
HAHA I was maxed my man  name is taut actually can look me up.
We are getting the same shitty weather here rn too

It is about 50 degree Fahrenheit raining and windy. Not very nice out haha

Yes you know its an awesome community when you feel like youre home
I heard its hard to find job nowadays for CS major
Yes mate the mods are always watching thats why you need to be helpful
Bro I feel that! I just finished grinding through BearX and then came straight here lol
looll facts!   anw you in 0xdao?
the job market is horrible in america now. BLEAK.
My biggest fear was majoring in something i didnt want glad i chose healthcare lol
Yea it is the best state in my opinion. Once I make a bunch of money off of NFTs and crypto I am going to buy a house down there somewhere near the Atlantic ocean
Same my guy really looking forward to mint this project they are the best pixelated Ive seen personally compared to kongz and kajius these are more my style 
good news this team is capable of not pulling the shit that bearx did no efforts going to waste here dance3
Same here in NY bro could use a cup of hot chocolate right now 
Yeah good day to stay inside then! Ive got so many errands to do but dont want to  done with the bloody sweeping autumn brings
Did Cs my first year and switched my major just learnt your code myself
Its wild bc my girl watches some stuff on my phone and i keep on getting those trends on repeat. Tik tok kept a great medium. I was a hater at first because of all of the dancing but social media made me have to like it because of the content. 
Taut wow mad cool dude. You got a 4 letter word in osrs. You can sell your account for so much lmfao. Prob like 2k or more. I only got to like lvl 120 at most.
Ky i heard they were going to bring in teleporters when u kill drag
Dr. CheekClapper you need me on your team
you dont play any video games? Understandable as most people dont got the time
i just like to blaze at night or watching movies
Yes thats why we help people around us
dang man how long have u been active here lately! 
he from new york he just meant its really cold I THINK.
i like the community am just chillin in da caves
We get issued it in America. It comes in the mail with free samples of tide
That is good to hear! I need that stability  I cant go through that again I felt Like I aged 10 years haha
Lol yea definitely! I am already ready for summer to come back lol. I dont care for the cold damp weather at all
I went down the database management route. I was a mechanical engineer but life got in the way lmfao. I regret not thinking about cs when i had the chance man. Honestly if you want to go to cs you should try to switch to something you really want to do.
Yea watching movie is nice  so much enjoy it hehehe
i thought we were talking blow lol
I could yea but ive kept it lol 
Im looking forward to surfing on snow a little first 
LMAOO i hear you did similar with guardians of metaverse didnt go too well for me Kek
Id rather surf in the ocean when its nice and hot out lmfao
ya my friends been applying to over 600 hit interviews but nvr landed a job
Its nastolgic af! Thats why i still have my account. I like how you kept yours. But that game has been going down the sewage drain for years
i keep hearing its suppose to be a mild winter in the us this year
Yeah i was actually the same i hated it because of all the dumb trends coming from it but i grew to like the content on the app.
Hahaha true that! We just pop down to Okinawa for that its cold af surfing here
Tried that in Sydney and fell till my butt hurts
yea i havent checked up on it for ages. But like Ive said Ive moved on from gaming for the time being.
it takes a special kind of person to live in the concrete jungle
Hurts when you fall on hard snow
Haha yea screw getting in the water when its cold lol!! I like the way the snow looks but then i get sick of it in about 5 days lol
i would like to snowboard one dayyy Think
Lmao they dont have snow do they
Yea yea hea hahahaha out of topic mate
Rejections sucks but its a part of life. Believe in your grind and dont let nobody tell you otherwise!
caleb what do you watch on tiktok? I have been watching the trend where it goes. Oh no the table its broken LMFAOOOO
i tried once and shat myself a bit second time was much better though
PUBG all the way these days my guy!
i havent been hearing about it lately is it any good?
Yeah oof haha so much chaos going down this week bro its crazy! What you think is happening?
The snow is super dry and fluffy here  I dont mind it  except when I get stuck or I wake up late for work with a meter dump
its older now and they have other games out like bloodborn and such i havent been into lately but i loved them bc the game mechanics were challenging to say the least
LMAOOOOO makes me not wanna try PeepoGiggle
We are gonna go back eventually. One day youre gonna be like oh wow. Lets play some osrs rn haha
yea maybe thats why i still got my account haha
good morning guys hows my wyverns fam doing ?
Shiba pump eth ath no good for nfts rn just gotta wait for recovery
Oh my god the its actually funny if you lip sync stuff is the worst. But a lot of the content be catering towards fashion and music that i fw
ohh its look quality !!  am new here !
sup doing well thanks for asking. Hope you are too
lmao.... we get wet heavy snow with muddy ground under it usually
ive lost like 20 ranks over the last few hours
Yes mate i need a new one hahaha do you have a new ine ?
No were just joking bro were in the same country thats why i know what he thinks
great bro had a good sleep hope yall have a great day todayt
holy  the new sneak peek looks insane !!
maintaining rank is the hardest part
lol cant take a break until that name is green
omg beyond stressful at times you die a million times as a new player. the fighting mechanics is very precise you cant just run through a level something will get ya 
Yeah sounds like back home in Australia  icy or muddy
You spent too long to give it up for some monetary gains. Its like a child to you at this point. Same for me. What do you do now after you stopped gaming?
caleb that one is my favorite right now. Do you watch the ones with anime scenes and music playing in the back. Its actually mad cool to see how far anime has come along
Spending all that time on nfts now 
no work for you only wyvern MachoFroge
nah i dont but ngl i get terrible shit post memes more than the fashion and music 
but what makes it so good? im more of a fps person!
i work at cfa there are no bathroom breaks here there are only breaks
Yea thats exactly it. Big ass ice storms sometimes and lots of power outages
You mean the fire breathing wyvern?
Is that kaiju yours on your pfp? I just started nfts about a month ago
caleb thats how you know you are enjoying those terrible memes LMFAO
for me it was the challenge of it. i enjoyed the difficulty and the highs and lows of the journey
Yeah facts I was more talking about the hax lately  pretty wild bro. Seems almost like one group doing it
Are you checking your rank a lot of time ?
That reminds me I need to change to winter tires 
   how has your nft experience been so far since you started a month ago?
awesome dude what do you think about wyverns v. kaiju!
Oh man me too. They are expensive for my truck. It has 35s on it
damn fr? its tuff as hell but mods need to be more cautious when they are part of a big project or any project for that matter its unfortunate how much damage was caused from such small negligence
thanks my man  hal Its following a similar path and its got a great team behind it thats dedicated. Huge potential for wyverns that is for sure.
yeah i know do you play any other games? the witcher 3 elder scrolls etc.
Take a break bro you feel tired.
Man the grind starting to take a toll on me
Stay hydrated if youre grinding all night my man
Thats so cool when i tried to do the riddles discord closed on me and i couldnt even see it until it was over. It was a disaster 
caleb haha honestly this is the most i have ever spoken on a server. The other nfts are invite based which is sketchy because you dont know how much organic people there are. But besides that i am having a blast meeting new people lol. Is that corny?
Wow thats hard just be helpful mate and youl have it
Cant gotta grind it out until I can chill and talk normally
You got to get in the top 200 and then hold that rank until they take a screenshot I think
top 200 by snapshot random time guarantees whitelist otherwise team is actively rewarding users that show organic activity within the server so that people who are at work or busy dont have to stick to computersphones for wl  
Yea i got in real early so had whitelist before all those gamesevents 
Seriously! Its pretty sad that people out there live just to screw other people over too. Seems like we as a society are losing grip on the term good honest living lol
use to play elder scrolls i watched the witcher but havent tried the game is it good?
anyone in here ever tried Pocky ? its a snack
Do you know of bdo? Its sort of like new world lol
Taut sheesh taut. Do you follow anyone in particular for NFTs? Ive been trying to find a good source on information but its like a wild west out there
disgusting ass people fr if you really put honest effort in this community then you can easily make money people will always look for an easy way and harm others in the process though just how some mfs are
maaann you should play the witcher 3 game!! its a no brainer! one of the best game ever made!
Yea thats right mate but if you cant do top 200. Just be a helpful one
Yea and im sure they only went up this yr with how everything else here in the US has been. Inflation is crazy over here man our money is going to be worthless soon. So glad I found crypto. Have the prices of everything went way up over there too?
I have a group of friendsfamily that we all work together and help eachother.
not at all man this is also my first time actually talking in a community for a project. Its a great first experience participating in organic growth as your first project that you want WL for 
This chat popping lol great to see such amazing people come together
Lets gooooo where are you from?
Yeah but if there is money to be made i cant blame them that they are using their skills to their advantage
when this projecet open on discord ???
Yeah bro i feel that you working so hard to get WL
scamming has no excuses its scummy asf and karma will hit em back one day
Pretty sure its just been a couple days bro crazy growth already
ill definitely check it out thanks for the tip.  lately ive gotten into the old nes and snes systems out of the attic. introducing the kids to all the old systems watching them fight over mario kart just like when i was a kid lol
yeah facts some bros need morals
TylerTakesATrip where you ski Ky yes I have
Whats up rock doing very well how are you?
Thats actually awesome. Im scared to talk to others about this because theyre gonna judge me until i make some serious cash you know. Im still in the beginning stages so i dont wanna talk like that and fail.
caleb this is a new wave. If everyone mimics this style. Then nfts are going to the moon
yoooo how you been doing bro? we talked yesterday dance3
Yeah growth has been absolutely insane since
I need that green on my name bro
you still got that old nes?! danggg 878781398566195210
No one wants to put that work in anymore! They just looking for a quick buck with minimal effort. And apparently dont care about risk 
Im as solid as a rock mate any plans for the wweekend?
Yeah they have and taxes are increasing gradually. Thats not good re inflation over there. It does seem like a rather troubling time at the moment kind of on a knifes edge
oh yeah you name it i have atri heck i have a commador 64.
i believe your name will be green in no time i see you conversating all the time!
forreal it is how it is just gotta do your best to be a better person
because its reallt organic . .Everybody looking organic project ...
yea people dont really understand this market nor the potential. Hope you get your big hit soon!
yeah man I remember you how are you? Im doing great just took a mini nap ahah
We in this together i seen you too brodie
Whos watching LAKERS tonight are u? Ky
Big fax i believe in karma too. Aint no way im putting bad karma in the world because i dont want it happening to me lol
Taut thanks man. I tried talking to my coworkers about it but they always brushing it off like how they brush off crypto loool. They think this is the same thing as crypto haha
Yea it really is man! How long have you been in this discord? I just got in here this morning but i havnt left all day lol
insane   the only old system i had was nds and gameboy!
for sure! do rest up ! need that energy to chat PeepoHeart
Thats the way to live my brother 
Hyxder If you are top 200 but already WL do you get another?
Yea its real early too many people are skeptical this does come with its risks after all.
For sure! I like your meka guden. Any good utilities coming out of mekas?
game boy is hard to beat tho my original giant hand held still works. they built them to last back in the day.
I got in yesterday morning man. All other projects have been getting fairly neglected to say the lease
Im doing well! you into any sports or video games?
Some ppl are just messed up and wanna screw with others
We are patiently waiting they say we are getting airdropped a companion and stuff we will see what happens 
nah its 1person theyre trying to keep as many unique holders as possible
When the risk is high so are the rewards. We are going to play nfts like the grand exchange baby!! Haha ifykyk
Thanks fam on my way to success diamond hand worthy
Any of u guys buying this nft dip? If so what are u looking to invest in
cave 2 is for the party people!
probably the most popular meme haha wait can we meme on here now?
yeah did you managed to get your hands on the new switch oled?
U ready to see how westbrick ruin todays game ? Ky
Thats so true! I do love that there are so many people in this community who are just super chill and so willing to help out whoever whenever! People like yourself will help grow the NFT space astronomically.
That is what I have done all day too lol.. I am in a ton of other discords that i normally chat in a bunch but not since I found this. I will stay in here all weekend if I have to lol
I dont have enough capital but I am hoping if I cant get WL for this project I can get a few on secondary for cheap
PltrBagHolder Well still win cause we have Goat James 
yeah community is lit and so many great people here
The only thing Im looking at purchasing today is an etholvant. Super cheap and its a unique project
That sounds cool. What does the companions do?
yeah fr is why i decide to stick around a lot really excited for our future dance3
Idk how lakers are gonna make this work 
guys seriously i only just realised i can engage in the cage 2 aswel LMFAO
no i dont have a switch they are pretty awesome tho do you?
Yea you too wish you the best with this one 
GNaga  WYVERN  nice youre in top 200
Good to know gives some breathing room on top 200
Seriously. Like they dont have anything better to do but ruin peoples lives?  so lame
Lets see if goat James can get this under control
anyone elses discord name their xbox gamer tags 
Not sure yet but its supposed to be a game I believe at some point etcetc I think we will know more after NFT NYC  
Hey guys feel free to reach out to me if youre new and have any questions about the project! 
Is anyone here going to NFT NYC?
yeah dw mod team is always lookin out
Thats their event? Nft nyc sounds sexy
 am fineee.. NEw here bro .tryng to undersand what going  on 
i did have the new v2 was looking to get the new model oled but not much a difference lol
Sounds like a good idea. Ill probably buy some as well
Cant wait to be a long term holder in this community
Its such a young space bro! And if there are smart safe educated people welcoming everyone and helping them become smart too it will be unstoppable.
Thats the way man before you know it you may be green 
SniperCake  look at faqs whitelistinfo announcements giveaways

How long you guys been here is it super hard for WL project is sick
A lot of giveaways in between ahha and also one trivia quiz some hour ago
hey how are u ? nothing much just chatting with wyverns fam here
ofcourse no . I am just work on like this projecet .Just organic and qualtiy communication
Its a huge event for all things NFT my impression is thats its THE place to be if you are into or making then 
Its hella cold but its also a very beautiful and full of nature type og country used to complain until I lived abroad now I dont think its so bad  where you from mate?
Is your pfp yours i like that one
Well its kind of going slow lol. Theres still like 2000 left
minse096 i was at the noon trivia. It was so hard to even click the answer choices on my phone. Must use a computer if you want to do trivia
animal crossing lol actually bought it and play for only a couple of days  not really my type thats why i prefer PC
Nice keep doing it mate youre doing great job
Are you super strong? Sorry that might be a stereotype haha
agreed its glitchy on the phone. good to note for the future. was driving anyways so i coudlnt participate
For sure!!! get sum of that H2O in PeepoHeart
me too dude ! will do for coffee
yeah bro just revealed two days ago i like your fpf too haha
Sup just chilling with everybody here
Guys its not a grind its hanging out with the fellas lol
Guden! When is this nft place? The whales are definitely going to be there and there are probably going to be booths to sell these nfts. This is a cool concept. Like a sneaker con concept
nice to meet you   I think we will see eachother here alot of time 
Jeeze thats insane. I hope the hackers get what they deserve man. What they are doing is Vile
Haha is there a stereotype that we are super strong? 
I was a bodybuilder for many years but that was more a personal choice not a Norway thing haha
yeah exactly stay active and help members out! If you have arts skills check out fanart !
PltrBagHolder Ky lets guess westbrick statsline today. I say 15 5 3 and 5 turnovers

Good just found this project yesterday was busy finally in and gonna chill
big facts though staying active and engaging with the community PeepoHeart
man the price of eth needs to drop soon
Haha yo apex how are you doing fam? They held a lot of giveaways in the am for the other side of the world lmfao
Welcome! What you been up to today? 
Lol 3 certain things in life death taxes and Westbrook getting 5 turnover a game 
Its 14 November in times square mate pretty big thing yeah 
i like how we are all secretey hoping for a retracement and consolidation lol
Its crazy the amounts they get away with
Or people need to drop mint prices on some of these projects its killing the projects how much it is now plus gas
you should be ashamed of yourself. how can u side with this warrior fan MAN
Yep never gets boring in here love it
Yes mate did you know that when you dont drink water for 1 day you will be finding water
Good to know. Thank you for the information
ChankZillaAMG hello chank how are you doing today?
Yeah man big time coming back on them. I really dig your pfp man thats sick!
Cant even swap USDC  GAS is more than what I wanna swap
gas is relentless man. its brutal
If we all keep this up we will all be on the wl before we know it!!
yea thats also true projects cant keep making 0.08 mint price when ETH and gas are thru the roof theyre killing their own projects
yeah man gas is rough these days
PeepoGiggle  for sure I will be finding water I should hydrate myself as well hehe
PsycoSmurf  awesome so many cool channels ser jokes pets food movies  make sure to check giveaways frequently they are snraky
havent seen gas go down in the last few days mang
Hes right unfortunately. Westbrook is so bad 
We got this just keep talking to the community and be engaged in the project shouldnt be that bad
Yeah Im just waiting for projects to move over to IMX for the fee reduction but also it depends on the project like this project is worth the gas 
last time i fought a shark with my barehands
its ok Goat James will put WB in his place
Dude seriously! It is insane! When you start throwing triple digits around of eth 
For new Wyverns joining us check out announcements   faqs for detaisl on the project.
Shiba is still ripping through gas with all the transactions
Praying that things will get better!  
Yea I agree man I think we will get hand chosen if we jsut keep it up in here
doing good! grinding for this WL
I sold my kaijus cause I like this project more lol
Thanks fam! Its actually a picture my son made on the computer! What you up to bro?
Discord is already almost at 7k 
Wow so nice. Just grinding tbh and developing a sniper tool for Sol hbu?
Ya discord is growing fast ill never make WL lol
i feel that its gonna reach 7k within 3 hours PeepoHeart
Wow it was 5k yesterday! And to think its all organic
Yeah almost 7k your welcome mate
Maybe  Im everywhere bro  Morchize oh nice fam! How is that coming along for you?
Dont worry fam you got this! You are a day earlier than most people here
That sounds very interesting DM me so I can keep with your project might need that tool in not so long!
What would you rather a punk or a genesis cyber kong
I will stick in cave 2 for the moment. Eyes spasm in cave 1
Ya but didnt really start to talk in here until today been busy gotta make that top 200 lol
KEKWaddle  I love their username too
Lol good to see you still here buddy still waiting for my food delivery bud
Sheesh sorry fam! What did you order again?
Top 200 cut off is probably around level 11 right now. Everybody slowing down. LFG
Its hard for me I think Id go a genesis cyber kong
never can rest till WL BLESS ME 
I was J Walk ing my big Jabooty  LOL if u get it
Rank 700 right now lol long ways to go
me too bh the passive income is huge
Id go with a genesis kong personally
I was just there yesterday. Where are you from fam
I really enjoy it here though everyone is super positive 
From US but moved to ireland couple months ago WBzu
Agreed ! I would go for a Genesis Kong as well because of the passive income AND because with time its only going to get more valuable and who knows they might become even more valuable than Punks if any greater utility is introduced to the project.
Lol I get it brother how you doing still not slept yet bud?
i assumed everyones watched squirt game?
i love it here you guys are better than my real friends irl
Thanks haha it seems to be pretty popular. DEATHWISH my brain is moving too slow for you to be making me laugh like that bro 
smile  that typo tho but yea ive watched squid game hehe
fax! team and community is great
Started school in buffalo. Stayed for the experience. Why did you move to ireland?
Hello im pretty good how about you mate?
Yall think btc will go to 100k this year
Thatd be nice lets hope so. What time is it over there?
Wife was born here but never really got to live her so we came so she could connect with her roots
Yeah I agree! The potential is so insane imagine another spike to there passive income when the bull run comes
Bro nope they installing air con so loud! 26 hours awake now its 1pm I got wirk again 11pm
Nice bro goodluck to your work do your best
There can be multiple spikes really because they can introduce more utility to the project which allows the owners to get more gains of all sorts.
Thats awesome of you man. What have you been up to in ireland?
All channels can get XP? Anyone knows?
Where were you before NY just enjoying the beauty
Its 8 pm and Ill have to get off of here soon to put the kids to bed and eat dinner but I get up super early and will probably be back at it by 3am my time
Yes you can get XP in any channels
Oh dope! 5pm here! Where you from G?
I lived in nyc all my life. Are you retired?
Good idea get some rest before a big push. Family time then your time you know the drill 
Thats insane mate you should try as your not gonna survive for work lol
Everything is sold old and nice im out in the countryside so way different then when i was in us i lived 15 mins from boston so it was very populated  na im only 36 just made the jump lol
Chicago the best city in the world
o snap ! ive lived in NYC all my life too party
Yep that is what I love about them but I think the punks are safer bet in terms of volatility
lol i walked in the cave at the right time
How is it to actually live there? Media makes it out to sound so scary in the US 
Just waitinf on visa so i can get back to working but for now doing crypto and NFTs
I know man they making to much noise drilling and stuff Im about to drill them soon
Really? I know that Punks can multiply in value as well and they can be worth 10s of millions who knows but safe side I would go for Kongz. 
good morning bud. how r u doing???
for sure NYC rlly do b xpensive to live in pepesad
Yep exactly what Im thinking man. All day push tomorrow!! Hopefully I will see you back in here
only 10 away from 6800 members lets get it gang
For sure if my wife doesnt kick my ass 
Lol i would love to own any of these projects maybe one day lol
Oh word! I have only been in the Chicago airport! Im from AZ. You always lived in Chicago?
rlly do be tough living here  there are rats all ova the train tracks  here and there PepeHands PeepoEek
Yeah always lived here just went to PHX 3 weeks ago
Ofcourse! I would as well! We were talking about in theory that if we had the option what we would get!  Hahah. The dream right now is to become part of the NEXT Kongz or Punks that would multiple in value like that so we are at the ground level of it already. Because that is the only practical thing possible.
Oo dam it mustve been a hard year covid and all. Man! I wish you the best of luck sir.
I only think that personally because they will always be known as the og where I feel like if one project was to disappear from them 2 it would be the kongz
its a bit early for me on the west coast but im planning on getting some Indian or Mediterranean food tonight
Shes been a bit fed up of my grinding lol
Lol you not got any headphones or anything?
bro i been craving indian food today too
Wishing all the fam a good daynight
What celebrity would you rate as a perfect 10?
Thanks ya we just came here right when restrictions were up it pushed our move back a yr though
Was pretty good just found out about this project from ryandcrypto. How was your day?
im tryna get some garlic naan and chana masala
Honestly I agree with you. This is more likely. The OG project always has a better stable value than anything else so Ill side with you here!
Same here man lol... I had just told her I had enough good white list and then I seen this. Looks like we are staying home this weekend too lol
Only my ear pods do shit all lol
LMFAOOO yaa smile prettypepepuke
Reminder! messaging us and asking for a wl spot will def not get you a whitelist spot XD. If you think youve grinded a lot then be patient and we will notice you messaging us will only make us think you are grinding for the wl spot only and not for the community interaction thanks 
There you go we agree in every aspect lol
Good night tonight for activities no?
Do you guys have a farm and chickens? Haha i had to ask since you said youre living in the country side right now
Nice bro im good keep doing it mate many slots left so meaning chances left to get a WL spot
Lmao right!? She went to her friends place with 3 of our kids last night. I got one baby winning
For real bud thats rubbish hope you get some sleep soon 
lmao I would be wigging out if that happened
Haha we do not but tons of them here ton and tons of sheep everywhere ireland is known for their wool
Oh nice! What brought you over here?
Hahah smart people tend to agree.  Haha. Small question what is the most valuable thing about the EMETH Project that attracts you which makes you bullish about it?
Me too did you saw the sneak peaks?
been grinding val i wonder how much my ranking dropped lol
She definitely drew the short straw
To be honest bro I havent even looked at the project me and my mate share this discord as we are business partners and run our business through discord. That project is his haha I am all in here
grinding in the car? i respect it
Oh hes an admindev on the project really? That sounds pretty cool! Ive seen many people have the PFP so I got curious and got into the discord but havent seen anything properly either.
Yup hopefully we all will be able to get in to the WL spot! Just have to continue to be helpful and interact with people here!
You just hear baaah baaaaaah everyday. Do you not go crazy because of the constant baahing LOL
Ah word! How you like it over here? Weather should have been pretty good! Yall do anything fun while you were out here?
Well I think Im going to get off of here for the night and get back at it when I get up.  Good luck on that wl spot man. I hope to see you green when I come back!
I was actually wondering about something does anyone know if they will include these rare ones that are animated in the ones we mint or do a auction like kajius did?
More people to chat it up and talk to! Rather than having 1 cave which gets clogged
Yes thats the only way for sure.
Been good chatting mate. All the best and happy grinding may see you later !
Just saw that legendary is so sick
Im not to close to any of the farms thank God
so far away but i gotta make it
Oh no sorry that is his project he is trying to get hahaha sorry bad wording by me. Yeah I see them everywhere. Havent had time to look yet been in here 247 lol
Yea I like that its pretty dope tbh still crazy in here which is lit
Why is there 1 minute cooldown. It doesnt matter cus i live the vibes
dropped from 205 to 255 all cause i had school and two doctors appointments   Ky 
Twas nice! Went to some arcade bar
For real though. You literally go to every channel and its pretty active
LMFAO. Thank the lord haha. Do you go hunting at all? What is there to do in ireland?
Its so good right? Thats fire  bro LfG

Been a real good talk buddy!! I hope I see you tomorrow.. Have a good day man
So you got the WL for it yet or no? What exactly is the WL process for this specific NFT?
Without the 1 minute cool down messages will be flying around too quickly!

Hello I see you everywhere haha

How do I check my rank or whatever?
AOT fire show ngl top 5 anime all time

slow roasted pot roast is on the way I love grubhub lol
hey Danny  we can get whitelist by grinding to top 200 level?
Literally no nothing bro I havent even looked at there discord my mate is into it I am just focussing in here at the moment. But it does seem to be getting a lot of interest
ico Guden I was talking about a different project dude.  Hahah but thanks anyways! But I know the way to get WL here! Just be engaging and have fun and honestly that is all I am doing and the time passes like no other.
Oooo have you met anyone interesting?
Thanks for spending your time with us my friend sleep well
dudeeee that would be insane I think im gonnna get lucky here tbh
Yea its amazing. I finished it in 2 weeks lollll.
We are all doing our part grinding in this war
I wouldnt call it hard I get to chat with nice people and learn about their interests lives and region. Its quite fun it is time consuming though. 
I dont have much hope for getting top 200. But mods are creepers. Always watching....looking for genuine community engagement and bless with WL
i should watch it. Had a few friends say its really good
this almost sounded like you meant it badly
Hard no requires commitment yes
Lol define interesting theres some crazy hick like drunks at the pub all the time lol
Thats one way! There are also other methods such as participating in the giveaways or memes etc. Being helpful and contributing to the community here will be considered too!
Yeah we are all probably under 3k
Only looking through the sneak peaks and its so crazy how much detail cant wait for the drop also thanks VeroSolo and ico
Just chilling in here man do our part for the project
Get it bruh  Ill be cheering for you! 
Its amazing. Also guys. Whats the point of the cave and the cave 2
Aot is amazing one of my favorite animes
Hey dude! Werent we just talking in the Furballs server? 
The good thing is they actually will check for bot so the levels grinding will be smooth
and i for you fren there are 10 triplemonkas
Been hard to find really good projects there so much out there now hard to know which is worth the time to put into
One chat makes it hard to talk cause messages are flying
Are the quizzes random times every day ?
Its to spread the load of messages I believe!  there were just too many messages going on two days ago and it can get overwhelming!
Whats the funnieststupidest thing they have said? LOL
How was yalls friday so happy its the weekend
Ok thanks. Also where can I check my rank?
Loving it more! where are you from Morchize
hehe welcome to the wyvern disc man! it is tough getting two whitelists at the same time Kek

Thank you. What is the difference between the cave chats?
Yea. Spread good positive vibes.
Sheesh sounds dope very private huh

Theres no difference. Its just based on preference
Still not bad! Dont focus too much on levels. Theres more than 1000 wl spots....just hang out in the VIP cave. What u up to this weekend?

Yeah fairly private you have to drive everyhere tho

The vibes in this discord  immaculate.
As long as theres no traffic might be nice?
I think fire took the cake this round what do we havew to do to get another sneakpeek 
So put in work every day for as many hours as possible and dont write generic messages or simple one actively take part in conversations of all sorts and the mods will notice you for sure! There is no rank requirement just need to stand out as someone engaging in a positive great way!
Yeah sorry I work full time and unable to grind but will try to make it to the events! I enjoy participating
whats going on peeps  new to this project looks fireeeeee
A good discord community makes for a great NFT project
Yes and no if you touch the freeway which is 10 minutes away then extreme traffic most of the day still in the bay area.

Me too just 1 kiddo tho. Hold old?
Hahahah that time will come dude.  Dont think about it too much! Were all early here so just need to have the excitement to engage and well all gucci!
LA by far doesnt even compare it does get bad sometimes though. But LA still has traffic when highways are 57 lanes wide lol
Morchize Agreed parents really like it here this was their dream.
Grind is about to make my Gf GTFO  
cave 2 is what cave 1 wishes they were
yes sir have not given it up since i joined dance3
Why are there two different caves?
My son is 1 trick or treating he 6 but i have 14 yr old and 16yr old girls
Two caves cuz too many convos yuh
Indeed! The success of a project depends on the community and its great to see we have such a strong community!
just to split up the chats to make it bearable to read
Where is the art inspired from?
Exactly you in college or highschool maybe graduated college?
lmao i always avoid going to LA
in 2 weeks theres going to be a war between the caves the victor will keep their channel while the other dissapears
Always thinks theres someone else... Haha 
its more relaxed here slower pray
Wohooo we have passed the 7k members mark!!!!  Welcome to everyone who just joined! Let us know if you have any questions about this project!
Can we please add this to the lore? Because it actually sounds so cool! Haha.
Thats a relief. My eyes cannot keep up with those spams chats
Nice. Hope you gonna make it bro
This. LA has traffic almost 247 now. 
PsycoSmurf  ah I have a 2 year old. Theyre fun when theyre little and we can dress them up. Good luck with the teenagers tho. I dread when shes a teen
does rank change base on your activity?
wow and the night is still young
Morchize Senior year so far so good. What did you study in college?

Right back at ya hope youre doing great
ive been here the whole day haha. Definitely am enjoying this community
right so i saw in the annoucements
cheers mate ill name my first born dragon after you
Yeah manually or reach top 200 bro until the deadline
I used to think people who play games or on computer all day wont make it in life. With NFTs and crypto that has changed my mindset and Ive become one of them
Top 200 is crazy. I dont have that kinda time lol
we all grinding to top 200 an stay top 200 need to sleep like a goldfish eyes always open!!
It is! The community is on fire and we are barely a few days old. Let us know if you have any questions on the project and do check out giveaways or triviaquiz for the chance to win WL opportunity!
Private college so smaller classes made it ez plus i got a way with skipping class and shit lol just naturally good at it
Feels so great seeing an active community fair and organic
Yessir I think we are the best organically
idk if ill make it or not but ill give it the ol college try
superwasheddevil lol hahah you making me laugh bro
you guys have done well to make it this way 
are you the actual official csales
That seems a lot better lol Im planning on majoring in business management not a 100 on it tho
what is the difference between cave  1 and 2 frends
definitely is easier with good mods. so great to see you guys reward people while always being so vigilant
We lal made it possible. Cheers!
the most fair ive seen any community be
Growth is insane. Its been 2 days and already up to 7K with no invite competition!
DO it for the girls and you will be perfectly fine
Anyone here watches skip and Shannon ?
cave 2 is chiller and chat msg doesnt go by quick. And everyone here is cool af

Hahaha well my name is actually Muiz so if you like the name go for it. 
For all those who are new be sure to check out announcements and whitelistinfo  for information on the project and on how to get WL
I think im trying for the top 200 and artwork
Thats true ill chat in here more than cave 1 lol
Its always about giving what people deserves
yeah this is such an underrated aspect. no invite competition growth is so meaningful. WE ARE BULLISH
Yup! It is super amazing to see so many new members and it is all organic growth!

Dr. CheekClapper always great to see a fellow doctor

hahaha unfortunately im a fake doctor so no one should ask me for any medical advice
Thats the plan. I just hope everything goes well just thinking about college stressed me tf out lol
Imagine how much faster chat will move in a week
Lets just say coincidence? Haha its nice to meet people who are into chem
Hi fellow hatchlings im new so im probably not early but so good to be here!

 Dr. CheekClapper actually havent gone
DURDEN I hope you are right set
yea bro thanks i totally agree! heaps of potential for this one!
Lmfao I feel that I got a girl too
fair enough its definitely not for everybody
I just hope Im not the oldest hhaha
Headup bro well get through thhis
Very high chance! The community is always a key ingredient for a successful project. Just look at how active everyone is here! We are selecting diamond hands to be part of the whitelist and I am sure this will do incredibly well!
slightly more chill chat I think haha
this is where all the cool people go
Not much just chilling with the best community
Yeah bro very promising that is why i like this project
We can build chemistry in here were fam!
its crazy how fast its growing too!
Dr. CheekClapper yeah im kinda grinding on my own tbh and have done pretty well so far. where do u go?
caleb whats up brotha ! i wanted to play val for so long tbh. and
lets get us Wyverns to the moon and beyond!
Morchize I just cant tell if im falling out of love or if its just been 2 years and things are just different yk anyways that was my ted talk haha
Although its fun to see all the questions
Just jump back and forth between 1 and 2 thatswgat im doing
true haha I guess I can be good at that
The cave 2 is just a little bit slower ig
Hopefully they will start purging bots
Good old American Chinese take out. Boneless spare ribs and lo mein
petition to move thecave2 above thecave
cave 2 is easier to keep up with
Sometimes you want new new even though you love ur girl
for sure!! we finally reached 7k members !! eyess
Feeling great and amazed as ever. Hope you guys feel the same
absolutely! where are you from fellow hatchling?
a strong community is so important and I can see that here
yeah its fun to respond to people and help them in there hard to have a convo with the chat flying tho 
MAGNESIUM  thats good glad to hear !
Feeling great fam just hungry rn
great team i think they will do a good job
A good community uplifts each other!
This cave seems to have a more reasonable pace. 
Yes feeling overwhelmed with this amazing community! Were like a family
i wish man but i havent gone. 3 years out of high school too
Very true many people looking for high ranks now
Were are to help were for the community
Yeah been feeling different the past month or so waiting for it to go away hoping our anniversary in 2 days will make things better if not. Well.... I guess we find out right
found out about this server this morning Hong Kong so couldnt be better  which timezoenn are you in
good ! love the pfp you still holding a donut? i still got one
steal from sneakpeek like i did
Yes the community is on fire here! I am in a few different groups and so far this group is on a different level!
i graduated from ucla two years ago with a major in pharmaceutical chemistry and a minor in international business worked as a life science analyst for a year and a half and now im starting a new job in 2 weeks at a healthcare AI startup in silicon valley!
Cave 1 is very fast! With the 1 minute cool down its pretty hard to maintain a conversation! Cave 2 is a lot easier 
Yeah man I was in the same situation dont let it go if you really love her tho
if you go to college go for the experience. and use college as a resource for what you wanna do in life. if you dont know yet its fine youll figure it out down the line
I got 2. Its so early for the donuts. Team is great. Project will pop off in NovDec
But dude both caves have the same cooldown? 
Type 1 if ur bullish on this project
Im surprised how fast this project is blowing up
I could tell already but thanks for clearing it up hahahaha love bro 
think cave 2 moves slower not people in cave 1
yessir you guys are amazing ! appreciate it
payamsal  yessir they havent released their coin yet have they? i love that team
Too busy in main chat lol came here
Just not sure if its love and the fear of losing her or the fear of not having a girl yk its just been so  long since ive been single idk what to feel.
great to have you man hope you enjoy it
Damn sounds interesting! happy for u
you stole my joke! and didnt even give me credit for it smh
More people are chatting in Cave 1 by the looks of it haha
Oh i see. Yeah bro... so cave 2 is better right?
Yeah both caves has the same cooldown
What is your level man? I always see you around haha
i think he is top 1 on leaderboard
thats the type of Magnesium that I wanna swallow
There are more to come stay tuned!
Mods are the truth here no doubt
i feel like when that drops floor on them will go up alot
cant fail if you dont stop trying
Cant wait! Thanks for the opportunity!
Welcome bro check out announcements
i prefer cave 2 personally its harder to keep a conversation going in Cave 1! More people in there!
whats is the differnce between caves?
Thats the hard part its not that simple.
this is just the beginning eyeshake2
Nothing just chiller hhere i guess
wow any teasers? Aint been this excited for a project in a long time
Ya probably. That seems to be the case with all those projects
The surpising thing is its only 7k members now! Imagine what 100k chat looks like
Yeah it is crazy growth over the last two days  and it is all organic growth! Cant wait to see where this will bring us
That would make a lot of sense hhaha
this is one of the reasons why i prefer Cave 2 as well ! PeepoHeart
Yep.  Honest and up front.  Come through the chillcave too much slower vibe
forsure! the team they got and community gonna boost it aswell 100 p you got a couiple rare ones?
Yeah i think so goodluck brother
I feel that . Attachment is real
No difference except cave 2 is better
Wonder what top 1s messages look like lol
so chatting helps for the whitelist?
is the gap between u and 2 still 10k?
And of course helping the community the most no pointless spam!
Ugh didnt mean to sent that emo actually.
bro thats absurd good for you! amazing wow. ucla was always a dream
Yeah chatting and be helpful to to other will help you
yep people are about to start talking about this project
Ohh yeah that point is true but I find it equally comfortable to chat in both because its all about chatting and talking be it for different topics in each chat!
jeeeeesus do you have a guess of when they will take the snapshot of 200 most active?
I think the whole project will just go to whitelist
Youre right bro it helps a lot and also community engagement bri
its almost like we need a cave 3 and 4  lol
The 2 at the time has a diff of 13.3k exp rn and the current 2 is 12.1k exp away
Well if you contribute enough you can noticed by mods
what is the difference between these two chats?
Yeah its scary how real it really is.
No just commons. Now a good time to snag a few more but Im low on ETH rn
Just stay active and eventually youll make it brother
Indeed we are! Now we just need to find a seat in the rocket 
ok i think this is the fastest chat i ve been
Same! Wyverns getting the recognition they deserve! 
thanks bro! you been here for long?
A rank that isnt high enough yet lol
Definitely quality over quantity!
i can contribute vibes but not much else does that count
thanks dude! its been a wild ride. i have the next 2 weeks off so just trying to get my feet as wet as i can in the nft space
pretty good really excited about this project
bahaha yeah my homie hyxder is super active and hes 1 on the leaderboard for a reason

TKBit Dr. CheekClapper holanihao ty sounds cool PepeHoldMe
Whats the different from cave 1 to cave 2?
Many people want to join a community. We are looking for a good home
MAGNESIUM does a wyvern generate breath by me holding it or do i need to stake it?
Yeah thats right and 5 breath will recieved everyday
Sitting in the Autumn sunshine try to use my laptop and ignoring the glare. How about you ?
Like far enough that we can smell Uranus?
Take a deep breathe and enhale the tokens
Yes everyone has a chance check announcements and whitelistinfo good luck and welcome to the most amazing community!

Wyvern  Prodigy ay thats good to hear can never grind enough
what is THE costume this year? squid games? all the different Lokis?
To spread out the load of message! If not things will move too fast like my first day here two days ago  we may need a room 3 soon at the rate we are growing!
Cave 2 is just better lol more chill and just a vibe overall
Feel like eveyrone is going as squid game haha
no need to be scared only 2553000 whitelist spots taken right now and there are still going to be tons of opportunities for whitelist apart from activity contest in the near future we had trivia today and 2 giveaways and regardless of whether top 200 or not the team is giving whitelist to people who are showing honest engagement. Keep at it fam youll get there
haha i feel like everyone is going as squid game
Im not sure what I was saying.. Had breakfast and id a couple of quick chores.. cant stay away from here for too long
We can definitely smell Uranus alright
awesome as you should mann. keep it up. very inspiring !
Whats up my friend? Hows your day?

PltrBagHolder Apex  I guess its super easy huh? still havent watched tho. Ive got a todder so paw patrol and disney princesses over here
Wow even with 60s slow the main chat is still rushing mad

ooooooh actually a great idea! Im not artsy at all but hey what have i got to lose right?
Check on website using officiallinks
Ive had Kaiju owners say they love the art on these wyverns sooo lfgggg
Yup plus these are all organic growth!!! Which I think that is why our community here is on fire  everyone is super enthusiastic!
Dc I aint kno yall say no kizzy out der
Yeah but its most people trying too hard to get noticed because since WL is by contribution and not by level so theyre just trying to get to top 200 or just as high a level as they can
who posted a video on the project?
Ty just changed my name to already show loyalty
We love the Kaijuz too! hope people dont try to make us compete the wyvern team is actually looking to collaborate with them in the future should Kaijuz wish to!
Whats yalls favorite mint style. Kaiju puzzle thing was kinda cool. But impossible
Sup mate hows you doing right now?
oh really? i did not know that guess some people are working for that then
it was fun but way too hard if u did it solo
Ah changing to thecave2  as cave 1 is flooded man
community growing fast as we are typing rn PeepoHeart shakecolors
what is the difference between chill cave and the cave?

Good to hear!! They are amazing
might be a bit calmer here haha
hahaha im just super excited and bullish. trying to learn as much as i can!

Agreed esp with all this DAO trending NFT this is looking to be one of the better ones! Just hope the discord doesnt get hacked like so many other ones
i am coming to cave 2 .. cave 1 is more for spammers
Here love  httpsdiscord.comchannels902798623744618516903338786816143400903809613898596442

tru good point but it looks quite alike u dont think so?
Poppin from cave 1 to cave 2. This is the way lmao.
Me too waiting n looking forward
you make a great point good sir!
Yea bro! I cant believe how many have been hacked recently. Feel bad for the creators who have a vision and it gets broken from them
tryna catch up on my lecture but i cant focus 
Regardless remeber to invite your frens and families. Lets build this
late hourss hahahah I know you feeling sleepy already too
ay nice gl japanese is pretty challenging
Haha its still early for me only 640 I live in PST
LMAOOO welcome to cave 2   gonna become like cave 1 soon prolly gonna need a cave 3 and so onKEKWaddle
i wonder if they could come up with something more unique than breeding! breed has been done before to insentivize holding the tokens.. whats the NEXT big trend? i want them to explore that route
wow theres so many chat channel I love em all!!!
bro i am surprised you havent gotten wl yet wtf
I just got here from ryandcryptos channel
Yes everything about this project is blue so far
nice planning on having anything to eat? maybe like a bagel sandwich or some
Hopefully we can make it to WL. Think my rank kjnda stuck in the 300
been in a lot of red so tired of grinding levels
legend! Ill see you in valhalla I hope!
Okay time for a new strategy so I actually get something done.. Each level up  12 hour break and do some study  chores
DAOs are in a grey area of the law...
bagels are so good  what do you like on yours?
Lying down starin at my phone aping into this shit lmao
Yooo that looks bad ! This is the one I used to have
have u taken a break yet i think ive been here the whole day with you lmao
same man its hard lvl 12 is 200 haha
Can share your tips here how to get green bro
Cant imagine your excitement that day
Wowww I forgot about the time zones for a while sorry mate! 11pm for me here hahahaha
they sure look alike but dragons have 4 feet and wings while wyverns only have 2 feet
Hahahah its the new NFT Trend but yeah there are definitely alot of them out there! Creators just gotta differentiate themselves!
ThePunter Yeah its actually crazy hopefully these mods have 2FA enable dont want to see this project get hacked 
prayge  Hyxder hopefully some time soon
sheesh respect to the ones that actually make top 200. thats a crazy grind but def worth the reward
i am from malaysia its 941am now.. hahaha wyverns go get some coffee in
i like creamcheese on my bagel also bacon egg  cheese toasted bagellsss . hbu what do u like on ur bagels?
My friend invited me here but Im just checking out his channel as well
trust me they have plenty in store for us apart from breeding here is a sneak peak of the game in alpha stage currently we still dont know the full utilities that will be announced but there will be more apart from staking  breeding  Were in for a wild ride it is a complex project 
I just think the tokenomics dont make sense
Think it will be like lvl 1314 soon cos more people grinding
do the mods see this? lmk how yall been! we appreciate all the work 
cave two is nice i can atleast read the chat haha
Be right back have to tend to my wyverns
Tell me about it who is it do you think these rabbits will ever go to the moon
TKBit thats sounds like a good goal
See you bro. Lets ride our wyverns there lol
good grind nice! you will be in the top for sur
that looks awful sweet if i could get a boner i would but i dont have a male part...
yep its hard man max lvl 21 by hydraxer?
Haha.. thats about as productive as I am being right now
Yeah gonna need it..  perhaps kanji NGMI
great insight man much appreciated
No bro. Would be heartbreaking. I see this being a blue chip in the future. The roadmap and limited numbers makes it so valuable!
nah i was away for a while had to do choresgroceries just vibin in the caves now
Seems like cave 2 has more proper engagement
cave 2 had more real conversation where cave 1 is full of spammers i am sick
it will get worse here over time lol more people are joining
not all caves are created equal
if im at panera i get the cinnamon bagel with the normal cream cheese but on my sandwiches i be going crazy sometimes. like at my local bagel shop i got a asiago bagel with garlic creamcheese and in the middle is the toppings of a pizza with red sauce and all sooo good.
I believe every channel has proper engagement   just chat are flying fast with many ppl online
ive seen that photo! its super interesting.. love to see what this team can do
its really good for ur health doe
Yeah I hope this project is a blue chip in the future! It will be a project that im finally early in ish
Nah I mean we need to be in lvl1314. I am still stuck at 8 and its sticky af!!!
def has potential gives kaiju vibes
suggestions we should all try and post comments avout this project in the comments sections on all the youtubers who cover NFTs. What do you think?
haha true but i think where we are its still pretty early. lots of spots open
Im almost on top 100! Feels good hahaha but have been chatting here foi a while today and yesterday!
yeah mate its 1 dao after another these days xD
damn that looks nice gotta be honest
Yeah thats why I came here bro more chill
yeah chat are flying too fast in channel one which make it unchattable.. too many ppl rushing for top 200..
will there be ones smoking? i seem to only get the ones smoking and chainsmoking
Its quite poignant the amount of hacks happening and the people that got lost in the sauce and their precious bags being taken a way from them...Gotta be careful in this space. that 2fa should be obligatory nowadays in discord. I love how Meka did it.
I dont know if they will or not Im trying to find something that will tho
Thats awesome! Im hoping to climb up into that neck of the woods
Actually top 200 is a bit too hard already a lot of ppl might just give up
persistence pays off  keep it up bro
sup crypto homie what coins we buyin?
blobyawn just woke up from a cheeky nap. Sup everyone?
cant wait to learn more about the tokenomics! whitepaper cant come soon enough
Ayyy we here! But loving Nets too
It was stock in that photo ! I only had it for a week there so I got it all tinted haha
Still wary bro! Look at how many WL spots are still left! Youre in a great position to make it
welcome back how was your nap refreshing?
Yeah! I just hope they do diversify the projects they buy in though! Another project I was invested in only bought Kaiju Kingz which isnt bad but I would like to see some diversity if you are reading this ShihTzu!
im good wbu? just missed the giveaway
One that I have mentioned publicly is Rdt. Check it out
it feels like this discord is draining on my internet 
Actually congrats on top 1! thats so much determination!

Shib and eth going to all time high is the reason
Im doing pretty well. How about yourself?
yeah tryna get my rank back didnt play for a few months
could be due to ETH rise ppl rushing in there are also rumour say because of the bitcoin billionaire project
Yup! Really amazing that the team has everyone planned out even before the launch! Curious to find out more about the teams background because this is amazing stuff
TKBit  just have to set limits or just say hell with it and vibe all night
its annoying in a way nft projects just tanked
LETS GOOO   we should be early enough since there are still a ton of wl spots left over

Thanks for the response bro! Appreciate it
billckq007  nah bro Im from Australia! What about yourself?
will you diamond hands when you get an offer like the one that cryptopunkz got  ? 500m usd worth of eth
The amount we have just now is impressive in itself
great things coming from the wyverns!!
true ive got 2 for now but you can tell this a good quality project
Now that sounds easily achievable! How insane would it to have a WL spot knowing youve guaranteed a future blue chip. This project without a doubt is going places
Hey guys whats up  hope yall having a great day
Im from Malaysia nice meeting uou
Anyone getting any NFTs on secondary in this dip?
is there any competitions for wl ?
hard to guess since we dont have a lauch date setted. 
how long is everyone in for tonight?
I would try to top frag in rank and that would make me play terrible so i was hard stuck gold for a min you copped the new BF? the movement kinda looks sick to me even though some of my homies say its dumb
Not yet I think nft will drop some more since eth looks so bullish
yes currentoy it is top 200 activity !
Souhate oh man congrats bro. When did u turn green? U were the one who asked me the millionate quiz?
Yeah but after were going to the moon
Nice meeting you too bro! Hows the weather there rn? So hot in Aus rn
ohwell the important thing is that the bots are doing work 
Oh yeah that would be ez moon LMAO if only.
We have officially entered THE CAVE!  That rings well!
oh nice have a feeling that they will do well. Im on og list haha. Waiting too long for them to drop
TKBit did you watch the video ?
dipflip Hahahahahaha i might cave but look at the guy who rejected a 9.6 million offer on his crypto punks
Fugazzi is grinding hard since yesterday. I remember you YGMI
Would you give up ur left kidney for wyverns
HAHAHAHAH why is that sadly true
Not to sure might go out soon hows the night going
rkm Can I bring you back to the states
the community is impressive so far  those spammers are not sustainable  they just gonna get their role and just leave the project
they are probably working on it lol
haha that guy had a whole story right? something about it being priceless and whatnot and that he isnt willing to sell
sheeeeesh im gonna praise u then!
I need someone to pick what kind of energy drink i have tonight Morchize any suggestions
Go make some meme try your luck memes    .be helpful for comunity its kay to whitelist
sheesh u a wild one. best i can do is give up a coupla pinkies
all Kaju owner you had your turn leave this for the ones that missed out .... hahaha jokes... ot really tho
That was a marketing stunt.  Owner took a loan and bought his own punk
That meme killed me. Not my work! I took it! Do not give me credit. Just sharing the joy
Very true indeed .. say no to spammers
they gonna get the ban hammer bro dw mods are awesome and see everything
whats the difference between cave  and cave 2?
Aww man that must suck summer is the worse weather imo
Nah i did not hahahahaha just sticking to BF 1 and 5

Limitless C00L this is the best cave
Working my way to top 200 now. I just started
yh its a bummer you dont know when it stops maybe you can predict it based on their timezone. owners should be from the Philippines
oh just read someone elses reply so it was a marketing stunt of an owner buying his own shit lame
same thing with MW2019 soo many cheaters and wz is even worse because its free. so the cheaters just need phone verified accounts to get on the game again and cheat
Haha they definitely keep you busy!
last week stayed up until 530am a few times on discord not happening again lol
always check announcements to keep  updated
I can see top ppl are already lvl 10. will be super hard to catch up with them
Yeah mans prolly a rich dude who doesnt care hahahahah not everyone can take a 500m dollar loan
That is very true. For someone willing to spend almost 10 million on NFTS only shows the spaces potential. Its definitely the new way of investing
Actually insane saw this guys twitter 2 days ago with 200 followers Im regretting not joining earlier
ay nice job man one step at a time!!
Ahahahaa not many of us but we exist ahahaa
Looking forward to get this cute dragon
Guys watch out for scam emails. they are starting... The Devs will never send out a DM...remember
Dont give up. sure can do it. as long as you do it with your heart  the mod will definitely see
foofeethefeefoo hey bro nice meeting you i am PJ selangor
When shib retraces it will hopefully lower
yeah its growing so fast i cant keep up hahaha
Cant wait for this proj to drop!
this cave is definitely the nicest cave around
i usually say morning instead of good morning because on a good morning id be truckin
yeah ive been busy with exams so I havent been able to keep up with this unfortunately 
Amen brother growing quickly. Really excited about being part of this project
you get the wl buy a wyvern sell it for 1m and invest it into an us company 
Hahahaha good to hear is there weather there as messed up as over in sydney aswell?
Hmm i think there are many people who do chatting on cave 1 compared to cave 2
Do u guys think DAOs will be in trouvble? cuz IRL fractionalising art makes those fractions securities
yeah its was a bad recovery for a few days lmao
Lovely fam day  I just woke up haha
yea market overall has been crazy lots of nfts are down
Yeah me too. It feels different eh
How many can we mint anybody knows ?
At the moment yeah its all over the place 23 and blue skys today tho which is a treat
always check announcements to keep  updated
Anyone else in the presale for the lions royalty club?
LOL! coffee might be a good idea....speaking of mornings
true true its a drag. but i think if you are active you will get noticed either way. so keep fighting brother
I actually go back and forth so I can hold 2 conversations with the 1 min cooldown
Cali gang gang raise ya handsss
Gonna be hard to actually enforce
some of my boys are crazy with the degen hours and plays during those times lol
Bro focus on CW. 1 CW is enough and greater than other NFT
Only 1 bro the stock is only 3k
Man top 200 is insane. Think i will have to grind 247
Have you checked out the road map?
Doing great  hope you have a nice day too 
Cave 1 is much faster. Cave 2 you can have a few conversations.. so better to hang here
For anyone new like me check the whitelistinfo  to know how to get into the WL
someone just replied to me and i lost the ping cus chats flyinggg smile  omg
hahaha true imagine the collateral you would need to even get such a loan
As long as you give me all of yours 
Actually 1 per person! That so good for the project!
By the time SEC thinks about it Bull run will be over.  NFTs are small atm compared to the rest of crypto space
Yeah all over the place here aswell sunny rn but meant to storm later
! Cosmic Wyvern  Broking T heyy man! Nice meeting you! how are you mate
naw man just gotta go at a steady pace and find time available in your day to be active!
You have to search the reply? Or 
I cant keep up the pace too fast
pumping out some meme wish me luck
Yea since its all decentralised. Just worried people will cause FUD then tank the token
Lets do it together ! Im new here too 
Its good to have a diverse portfolio to help minimize risk
Gotta get some rest! Catch you all in the morning!! 
Yeah I have  what about it ?? Theyre seem to be making some good progress  keen to see website
Thanks bro your pfp too as well
You too mate have a nice day. enjoy and have fun
dms should be off for every server you go to especially with the influx in hacking
yup pretty much who knows and it really becomes the next gen of mona lisas etc
GNaga  WYVERN  yup kinda lame but its we then. wonder how much further punkz can go
you can always move to chillcave  its not as hectic as cave 1 and 2 for the mean time there KEKWaddle
Lets get this body super stoked about this project
Mfka prolly a billionaire hahahahah but then cryptopunk peeps already millionaires now. If u check them wallets them peeps be holdin 50 to 100 cryptopunks a wallet. Thats crazy
im good brotha feel so good after lockdown specially i got hair cut the other day feel so so different
Everyone remember to set up 2FA and turn off private message from server! Protect yourself and ask for advice! We are always willing to help
Well I think we need something decentralized marketplace wise instead of open sea
youll get used to it in no time
Hoping for this to be my first NFT purchase I see youre in Head how is that
Sheesh the activity in cave 2 so fast now
yeah i rekon ive just been a fixture on here all day 
doesnt compare to cave 1 though
Im doing pretty awesome and how are you doing tonight? How did you end up finding this project? Also how long you been here for?
Seems like the website is being worked on atm interested to find out more about mint details when they come
can someone shoot the gas man please
yea with coinbase NFTs we will flood in at least 100 million new users
so much activity everywhere bro
Yeah I have  what about it ?? They seem to be making some good progress  keen to see website
hello! hope u are doing well too !
Lets rock to the moon with this project
it is but it will filter the ones who really want a wyvern from those who dont but u dont have to participate in the activity u kno
i didnt see gas get lower than 100 last 3 days 
Yes except NFTS have a purpose rather than sitting on a wall. The games breeding utility etc. the list goes on
Hahaha Im still trying to keep up! The fact that Im still struggling to recover from yesterday!
Gas more expensive than little projects NFT its crazy
Haha if youre down Im down lol 
I like cave 2 more  its slightly less hectic lol
Wow nice pick for first NFT my first was the Bored Mummy Waking up. What about yours first NFT guys?
Yeah cave 1 flying by lmao preal yesssir this project so fire cant wait
Good choice man! This is a great project for your first buy!
well i bet the ones that bought them bought a bunch since they were  1 eth each. or its a big conspiracy oh whales working together 
Have alook at their chill cave too
Not much. Looking into it more now though
thank you king! the vibes here are immaculate
problem is opensea has the most volume and users and NFTs need volume to survive its their life blood
yea man! slowly more and more people finding out 
ok this is very unique hahaha first time i saw a no exp day xD
Doing great here just woke up  hbu ?
Yeah Ikr that fresh cut just feels different makes you a whole new man
BlockBrodie yeah its good bro! I reckon its a good bluechip NFT chip they have bought quite a few in the top NFT projects that I like so far so going to be holding it for awhile
theres gonna be a lot of dedicate people in here that want it really bad
Totally but hopefully itll change in the future
we still have a lot of chance to be whitelist all of us are still new here just have to be active and helpful to each others participate in triviaquiz and giveaways
Yeah theres too many scam in there
ShihTzu  THANK YOU so much i appreciate it lol ive been zoning in on this so hard
Actually the big holders had all 50 to 100 of then minted since it was a legit free mint 4 yrs ago gahagagag
Im great bro todays a good day for the business
Just hard to talk in 1 minute bursts 
billckq007  Im with you except Im going to Mars
still gonna chill here xp or not   
Haha nice just woke up and here u are. Its the new norm now hahaha
No more xp. I wouldnt have minded a few more hours now that Im free
Yea yea and then its cave 3! Hahhaa
haha admin said yall can chill now PepeLaugh
The thing is for a nft project to be successful members have roles to play as well
alright yall i gotta go touch some grass soon
ShihTzu man of the ppl thumpLove thumpLove thumpLove
yep but you gotta remember supply is 100 wl!
people can actually get some rest hahahahaha thank you mod and dev u the best! very bullish on this project right now because of this l ololol
The gas prices are really starting to play its toll on some of the other projects that are just tanking in price between that and bear market cant wait for things to get better.
wafdawg but once they partner with IMX they gonna control everything. cuz no gas and high volume
ye bro really sad every transaction on os or minting cost me more 
Got to say it is an amazing announcement and initiative!
no xp day! thats so nice ppl are going too hard fr
yh thats really nice hate gas wars
How are you all doing today? Real conversations and then we all going to make it
I had seen that a very strong DAO project
Time to take a break and spend the weekend w ur loved ones!
LOL its a throwback but it makes me smile everytime haha
its kinda silly how fast cave 1 goes hard to keep focus tbh
I know I cant make top 200 Im just trying to vibe with people during my downtime at work
defo have to enjoy the quality things in life
Agreed but doesnt matter to me I didnt do it for the level 
Show some love on twitter fam!!! You can find there official link here officiallinks I would suggest following them and checking out some of the teams most recent posts! Some good content on there already!
Have a great rest everyone kinglove
yup all of it will be going to whitelist
Its getting more chilled now I like it even tho I cant hussle for my wyvner...
yeah idc about xp im not getting T200 anyway lol
hahahha insane i guess its somewhat fair since nft wasnt really a thing in the previous bull market
yea man gas wars can get pretty bad
Lol thanks my pfp is an empty gallery  will work for nfts! My first shall be a cosmic wyvern 
Yea cave 1 no chill here better
Haha yes! Real conversation still go on without xp!
I have a few questions how do we qualify for giveaway?
Yeah really liking the DAO trends so got myself into one! One of the biggest purchases Ive made so far
Welcome to the family brother this is a great community
No XP day is initialized. Rest those fingers. XP is disabled for 24 hours. Mods and Devs still watching the chats though and were still giving out whitelists all throughout the day. 
Take this time to do something outside this discord. Be with your family. Get that pending work done. Do some exercise. This community will be here when you get back.
to all the grinder! U should care for your health so if u feel tired do just rest!
So is this going to list on OS ?
Well always doing better than cave 1
Does any1 wanna bite? If no one wants ill just throw this 
never got insanely badly burned but did fail 500 gwei mints before
my bf Morchize ill see you in a few hours or in hte morning i desperately need this break
need to have at least 10 non spam message
Omg that looks so good !!! How yum
JNGUYEN  Cosmic Wyvern Wanna get into DAO but no more eth ahahahaha
Thanks close the XP   I can enjoy my birthday today
Thanks man on point! Be an active member and keep participating
Might die down that no more xp for 24 hours give us a chance to have more meaningful conversations at a slower pace!
Thats really exciting I was looking at a couple but its hard to know which ones to chose and not getting in on mint makes me hesitant
thank god for this announcement LOL my rank is saved for a night 
anyone here drive a vq car 350zg35?
when is the mint  whitelist claim date? Do you guys know?
You guys are the best clearly looking out for the community and their health. 
Nice place to be in cosmic wyvern haha
lol ive been in this discord like 56 hours today haha its been fun connecting with people see yall in the morning its funny too cause family just got here haha thanks again Mr. Master Wyvern
are u srs my birthday too anw we could get wl if i can proof today is my birthday haha
imagine if u got green on your birthday. Happy Birthday btw! 
yh i suppose so they might just give more wl out manually since the grinders are off to bed. altho you can always have those convos in cave to or the chill cave
got it boss working on it every day!
Ill present my true feelings for this project throughout this day
Guys go check out roadmap exciting times ahead!

We are for all of you thats why
bye guys going to spend time with the family mad Love From Sydney Australia
oh can you check mine and see if its non spam hahahahaha
Yeah the site has only been running a couple of days
oh exp is disabled but we can still hang if u guys are down
Were in the right place brother this is the way
Yeah Ive skipped a couple of mints just because gas was terrible
what if they pause xp to take a snapshot 
Now thats the present of a lifetime
And i must say you all are the best
hahaha yeah Ive spent most of my eth on the project  gas fees bro killed me but I trust in the project.
BlockBrodie yeah it is hard since it is based on what the community votes to buy in and how large the treasury is! But I do love the idea of staking NFTs!
Yeah insane how just last year NFTs were a silent dragon bruh. It was meh. But now it went nuts esp back august
And we will see exponential geowth in numbers. Amazing how all the chats here have no bots. Great execution
ur so active in cave 2 love it magnesium
well then theres nothing you can do anyway since exp is paused xD
i know just jk brotha i already chilling in here 4 days already
Any newbies that are unsure about anything please reply to me and i will help direct you as best i can! From a fellow newbie 
hahaha nono  I appreciate they close XP so I can go outside to enjoy real life 861687609490276382
How bout this monster? I present to you the jawbreaker!
ill catch you tomorrow have a nice evening! Thanks!
LOL damn 3 patties is a lot tho
best community I have seen in a long time flame
I kinda keep flipping channels holding like 2 or 3 conversations at a time with the 1 minute timer its not too bad. Just makes me dizzy scrolling the chat to find the replies haha. 
mrxclusive also hello to you Im pretty sure were in a few other projects together haha!! How you doing tonight?
Thinking on what to name my wyvern?
Cincai  ARKIPEL  Legend Nice enjoy ur day
healthy community means better chance for this project to stonk. Love to be here
Yea and staking needs gas as well. I have 1 halloween bear that has been staked. But there is a problem with their contract and now i got to unstake haizz
great idea behind the 24h grace period
Ky yea man its about the community not just getting top 200
There is bro you got to just grind
Bruh august bullrun was craazzyyyyy.
haha non spam as in just casual convo. I think your msg looks fine
Yo those burgers look fat ! Surely have to be American 
what u mean by no more exp  im gonna have heart attack rn
I am from Singapore bro! Read earlier that you are from HK?
I like ur name Magnesium  are u chemistry lover ?
Yup I remember your name. Im almost at the end of my evening shift then I have vacation. I feel I will still be on discord on my vacation haha
Aww man that sucks! But yeah everything cost gas man just waiting for eth 2.0 to come out save all our wallets
Dont forget to read the recent announcements
is there a chat to talk about other nft drops?
GN guys was amazing interacting with you all I will see you guys tomorrow!
JNGUYEN  Cosmic Wyvern What DAO projects u in? But eth 2.0 DELAY AGAIN LOL
i cant even remember my own name at the end of a work day
Hahaha we all should take time off for a bit. Also great opportunity to let us chat in a relaxed mode. All the best everyone
Damn ! Wish we had burgers like that !! Hahaha
I think there is bro u can check out rest of the other channels
you shouldnt man i think there is a 1525 exp per min cap so take it easy
oh yeah just read announcements  no exp for 1 day guys go have a rest kek
yes less LFG WAGMI or some bot intent here DAMN haha
You need to get a name Tag haha.
Just headdao right now and hopefully this one  but yeah looking for more projects to get into! What about yourself?
Yeah eth 2.0 taking too long to come!
lol no xp day but everyone still chatting haha. what a healthy community haha
seems like most people just drop links there without talking lol
But this proj does not have any staking and DAO right?
Probs cause of the no XP people are going to stop talking  good for those who actually need a rest !
are we gonna caught some bots today  kek
Have a rest or enjoy your time in here no need to spam fam 
WOW this looks bomb. Whats it called bro?
Yeah you can definitely tell the difference  you can rely on the almost 8K members here
I see you with that pumpkin head fam 
True Wyvern fans are showing now
i love this discord gave us xp break so we could spend time with family so wholesome
lol love that name looks amazing
This project does have staking! Their coin is  BREATH! 1 BREATH   1 BREATH 
That actually looks so good ! Im hungry now  ryngtchln  Im from New Zealand !
I can agree with that Ive got a few coming up ETH is climbing and Im so freaking strapped for cash i dunno what to do. 
mrxclusive yeah definitely wish I had some vacation going so I could focus on what I care about my family and the crypto space freaking job is just soul crushing lol. 
constantine its because I enjoy engaging with people and meeting new people not for the xp grind or Id be happy sending one message per minute with minimal effort.
yes sir it Saturday so not much to do but enjoy the chat hehe
Dont worry you are going to make it brother
ikr.. which project ever does that lol
Absolutely! We all fam here bringing good vibes!
Well we are here to chill as well 
That is just normal generation of token not staking. Like kaiju kingz and cyber kongz. But we will have LP here
im conflicted my eths up hella but nfts are down
Maybe Bot are off today remember the name and tmr they shall on back 6004spongekong
ShihTzu nice too see that you care a lot about us and let the people get some rest. havent seen this before good job
Wow  just when I had the weekend to get on this  But I have to say that this makes a lot of sense
So any of yall like drugs just sayin spice a chat up cause we in xp lockdown LOL
Helloooo ! Ahaha  cody405  it also could be bc people live in different time zones ahaha
i just finished exams today so it feels really good they did that
bots can rest for 1 day lol kek
grinding while market slow is the best thing to do now haha
Ahh really didnt know that! Thanks for letting me know bro!
super bullish! cant forget about gamification too
marijuana my drug of choice im just so compatible with cuz all i do is chill in discord
Just another example of the Devs  Mods here thinking about it  Well Done Cosmic Wyverns.. Go and see the real world out there
Yea man they already have models!
ah agree with that just mentioned it because i can imagine it being a headache switching between chats to have multiple convos
must be a nice feeling bro haha can focus on wyverns now all day
For WL ! Thats why ahah  but it also shows whos in for for the community
is there any bots here at all i couldnt see one all legit pp and good vibe here
JNGUYEN  Cosmic Wyvern OMG its called Breath! Fantastic! Im watching Godzilla KOM now with my son!
Ayooo ngl im high all the time im in discord. Helps with all the craziness ya feel hahhagagag we chillin
But why is ranking up important. Do we win something?
true that didnt see one neither
imagine if we all stop now we can catch all the bot being spam non stop
gas fees are actually making me sad
Not sure buddy have to ask Mod  I believe I see some bot and all get report and bye  
I have a little coke spoon for you ahaha !
ye watching the market go back up slowly also fun kek
Oh well thats something that is around and happens. Lets ignore negativity and be one big happy family
No probs ok imma head out and grab some food now bye man!
If youre ranked top 200 of being active you get a WL spot bro
I mean. You really gonna ask a guy named coke hahahahahaa
yup or cam just stay active as mods are watching us eyeshake
I just woke up and dev decides to give us rest? Haha
Its not too bad with the 1 min timer if it was 30 seconds I couldnt do it lol. I just find 1 minute is a long drawn out wait for a conversation but if we were at 30 sec chat would be impossible haha
Laters bro take care! Thanks for helping out 
im keep watching gas price from this morning always at 110200 all the time  
Hahaha yes the messages would just be flying around if it is 30 seconds or shorter! 
ETH Gas is a drug bro shit is always high asf
Bots have been reported and already take actions about it. If there are still any do not hesitate to report it to us. After all we all want a fair community
Lmao coke spoon aint discreet for a party home girll. U cant be carryin a coke spoon in ya pocketin clubs hahahahahaha
thats why we are here !and enjoy
true 30 s would be way too short. just find going up and finding the damn reply of someone a pain
Yes bro! Otherwise can get a WL through competitions they run! Can be found in faqs
However no xp the chat has cut in half atleast lol Im not finding it nearly as crazy to sit and chat now!!  How are you  doing tonight?
HAHAHA when youre a girl  you can do anything 
Yessss haha I might continue my sleep now
but I hope they will notice me too even if I dont get that
Ill keep my eyes out for them as best I can they just ruin it for everybody involved!   
constantine wouldnt it haha! Wouldnt be able to even find the reply to talk to somebody!!!
Oh wow even if its just people spamming chat? Surely the mods look at the actual engagement with the community
Wheres everyone from actually ? Just wanna gauge on time zones
there no exp today everything will be freezeeeee 
better have some fast fingers then and multiple tabs open or something xD
Ofc yall got handbags everywhere. But theres nothin like them old key bumbs. Quick and enough for 2 nose bumps ya feelll
Yeah no xp but the conversation still continues! I first joined 36 hours ago with one cave and it was crazy man! Literally couldnt read anything haha. With two chats it got better and now without xp it is getting even better haha. I am based in Asia so it is morning time here 
of cos not! therell be QCs on your convos.. the devs are always watching
yeah exactly going to grind this out all day long ahhahahaha
! Cosmic Wyvern  Broking T no lies detected!
Hahah its 330 pm on a Saturday in Newzealand Wby ?
Yeah thats what I thought HAHHAHA reminds me of Monsters Ink Im watching you mike wazowski
anybody get a skeletal wyvern shield drop when they slayed some wyvers?? 
yup bro make sure u enjoy and help as much as you can
is that why you guys decide to have a no xp day ? so more bots will be caught?
yes sir but all i can see is a genuine community in this cave kek
Cave 2 still better than cave 1?
ayyy in NY too u know the vibes chopped cheese from the ockk
i think those bots are mostly in cave 1 because that one goes so fast its hard to moderate
Infinitely. Cave 1 be aids hahahahahah
Hehe youre being watched all the time! Thats why bots here got kicked and banned even though they managed to get wl
This is the most genuine community 
haha the rivalry begins.... who has already committed loyalty to a specific cave? vote below... 1 for cave 1 and 2 for cave 2
they gonna caught u brotha u are Ai bot kek  jk jk
PA. Ive been in NC a few times mostly gatlinburg TN close.
Lol not sure what kind of bots can reply you haha 
holanihao I like it with no xp and 2 chats makes it easy to find the conversations and really hold them lol! Where abouts in Asia? Im in canada myself its like 1030pm here how is Saturday treating you lol
Just looked at cave 1 and can confirm.
Newcomer tips and tricks for WL Be helpful and active in the community it might just pay off  More details here announcements and here whitelistinfo

Havent been to Canada and am not super familiar with it by I heard there are one area that is predominantly English speaking and another French speaking? Guessing you are from the English speaking part?
Thank you! Will see you later on no doubt. Have a great day
mostly used for low latency stack but its a very good still to have
Ahh it finally calmed down enough i can come back to cave 2 lol

Cosmic Wyvern  Dat Legend just know man I just know 
Peter T. was gonna play some games with my friend but I think he fell asleep  anything going on with you?
it hasnt dipped below 100 in so long
Im from Ontario now there is a bunch of provinces here there is one Quebec is mostly French and then another place new Brunswick is a mix of French and English but most of the country is English. I cant speak a word of French and I wish I took it more seriously as a kid.
Im quite close to your place Im in Penang
i mean if that is your goal then thats cool but i think for the most part python is quick enough for alsmot everything these days unless youre doing HFT or latency sensitive things
are you sure bro I dont think thats how it works
sounds busy haha it was good! just spent most of my day playing games  did you do anything today?
YES! Im also a CD and CM holder! Glad to see a friendly few friendly faces here. yeah i figured that would happen after i saw the announcement
All the DOGE and SHIB users wrecking the gas price
3days  so far very sad make everything go slower
noticing there are quite a number of bears deluxe holders in here!
What to do in future hope is possible to come out with OS layer 2?
by any chance did eth almost or did it hit a new peak today?
Gas be criminal rn bruh at this point its like buying gas and gettin free NFT. Fked up hahahahhahah
oo what games do u play maybe we can play sometime. i did a few errands and just been on discord all day other than that
Need these alt coin run to dye down 
good so far better since ive found this amazing community 
Nice thats probably a sign then this is going to be a good project
lol. no just watching a fellow card breaker on youtube and chilling in here. any plans for halloween?
Bears deluxe that is one I screwed up for sure!  Bought 7 bw .01 and .1 and paperhanded them
yea its just all the people who wanna talk
im so bullish on the metaverse... That Meta facebook stuff is really interesting! i know people hate  Zuck but hes bringing in the masses into web3 crypto and the metaverse. this may be the BIGGEST bull flag yet for cryptoweb3..
indeed! there is a lot of good signs here!
bro u have best friend rh im paperhand them super quick  so stupid
I always wanted to make  HFT bot for the stock market but didnt wanna risk my money knowing how volatile it is and understanding calls at the right time is another story with graph analyzation and different formations
my main game is valorant ive been playing league  apex past few days but i just finished up playing phas wbu
BTC gonna end the year at 150k so imagine the gains on everything else
Might be goin down to Rutgers  chillin with some people
Hows it going ?! Doing much this weekend ?
hey good to hear and see your supporting it already
Alright cincai bro where are you from?
Only thing Im bullish on is. NFTs haha 
Any info when they going to launch ?
Sweet!! Great to have fellow dadmom holder in here. How are you doing fam?
yeah i think hindsight is crystal clear. I mean you identified the projects early and pulled the trigger!
i think the run up was a bit of market beta and everything went up along with Bears having one of the most solid communities
i knowww crazy time to be aline rn
not much i think my friend is coming to visit might hit a bar some time sunday how about you?
Anyone gonna be at NFT NYC? Im from NYC
Yoo thats good ! Just chilling at home whole it pours down with rain 
ye i like organic grow bro there always something good about it
Ok gonna be fun. Stay safe my man.
Well continue to build the community and trust the process
i think the nft run is going to come back like crazy
so if youa re doing HFT you really want to capitalise on the volatility. Ie volatiliy is your best friend as there will be discrepancies in prices in the market that you can arb. 
HFT is basically free money unless you have an operation issue
yea its kinda pouring out there where you from?
NFT run will happen after alt coin run
Im doing great! Just trying to kick back and enjoy my Friday night! Might have to order some food soon though. gettin the late night munchies
i used to play valorant until it got boring to me and i just got back into apex what rank are you?
WiFi not really working anyone else
rkmHeading to sleep baby have a good night queen
damn most the homies that i was having convos are off now sadge
I hope so! And thats the goal  How about you? Got any plans?
ahaha ye I guess ppl need to rest especially on no xp day
Bet!! This bear run really be killin low level projects fam. HUGE F all around the chart
organic growth is the only sign of good hype lfg
Australian here! I cant wait for international travel
ahh i find val really fun imo as its my first shooter  i reached pretty high in it im trying to get into apex for like the 5th time LMAO but i only got to gold
Im great!! Whats that on your pfp? Looks cute!
Find projects you have absolute conviction in and buy them up
this! 100 organic so far and its impressive
How is everyone in cave two going?
Everyone fighting for them spots. to much work lol
Wheres my brother v1 ? dude must be tired. Been super helpful in the chat. Definitely a real one right there.
the quality is there with the art as well 02yay
im good too pfp was my deluxe bear sad story cause i paperhanded it 
Facts lmao most projects had a 50 pull back
had to give some love to my girl lmao been on discord for too long
im so excited for the metaverse... imagine walking around Middle Earth with your buddies.. exploring HOGWARTS IN VR... it WILL happen because these companies that own the rights to these franchises will push the agenda because it will make them more money. and im all for it!!
at applebees rn whats good yall
Oh maaaan bears deluxe went on a good run!
Im good bro. Had a big night couldnt sleep thinking of this project. Its like Christmas is coming early
Yeap a good way to make the NFT to be a quality one
WL spots can change ppl life haha
understandable i get not everyone has all day to chat so 24 hr break is good 
awesome fam!! get the grub on my man. uber eats ftw.
your right on the volatility just dollar cost averging at the right time and reading divergences can lead you to think one thing is going to happen but sometimes its the opposite ive had my fair share of day trading and one thing i learned you have to be quick predict the future based on formations and based on volume know when to sell i guess my only issue is having enough capital to be worth my time to deal with market fees thats add up extremely quick
Gee you might need to have a rest up bro. Dont want to run yourself down! Seeing the green is giving. mexmas vibes. How exciting
IYKYK Clean wonderful what are you having?
So after the blow off NFT top all the BS projects will crash and blue chips will moon!
I keep buying PFP projects but i never change my pfp. My pfp too  i should NFT it lmaoo
So keen bro. Where the first place youre travelling? 
daddy chill yeah bro had a nap before recharged and ready for the day now. Suns up!
We dont have specific date for minting yet I think. But surely it will be the 2nd or 3rd week of November
Would love to continue conversing here but got halloween stuff  good thing no exp day is a thing rn
Sick OG mom btw. I was hoping for one to match my Dads background
Cosmic Wyvern  Dat Legend  im going to take a shower n be back on my bed with my phone brotha too tired to keep tracking this ridiculous gas fee
what rank r u in valorant? apex is fun u really got to learn the movement aspect tho
Checking the cave 2 it looks its still moving
i mean all the trades you are doing are going to be statistical in nature. so unless you have that wrong you are making the EV trade. 
if you are doing HFT you arent thinking about price actionformation etc
you are thinking about what you are selling against something or buying against something
Nice bro. Keep care of your health. Your body is the greatest wealth you can have. Drink your water too and move about. Lets go
I see cool! Its quite interesting to hear about how things are in the different countriesregion etc.  Which is why I guess having platforms like this is awesome for us to engage and learn from each other!
Cave 1 and 2 all part of cw community bro
It se more active cave 1 kinda slow down since all grinders quit the engagement
Ill be hanging out with the family. Probably family dinner and take my lil one out for some trick or treating.
Any other projects youre in or looking at fam?
I never said they werent brother all Im saying is that theres less bots here
immortal 2 atm i havent been playing consistently tbh and yeah apex movement seems so fun but i dont think i could be bothered to practice in the range D i enjoy learning stuff as i play it more
well atm chilling and chatting here should be the best thing you can do right now. Even though today is no xp day the team still keep giving out wl spots if ppl are active. So ye chat and enjoy 
Its 4am here and im still energised 
Whats everyones plans for the weekend? Im celebrating my gf birthday
Thanks devs and mods for caring about our health and spending time with family 
Yeah. Its good moderators did that. Otherwise Im sure people would run themselves to the ground and not be mindful of their health
I just meant about the project. If I get WL cool if not cool.
Yeah some how they got tired ahahah
Nice! I am looking forward to go back to Gurney Drive and try out all the good food once the border reopens! Ahhh all that Chao Kwey Tiao and Chendol! Yumzzz
Hahaha nah but some people were on for ages and they actually deserve a rest
Ayyeee whats uppp west coast reppin fam

Ive bounced back and forth between the two haha
Damn i see alotta bearX fam in this biihh
I dont know why but I feel much more easier to engage with others in cave 2 haha
oh thats pretty high what games did u used to play b4 val? yeah apex ngl its alot of practing and then u can have fun learn to tap strafe best mechanic they have and work on your aim it can always use improvement
right haha every time i look at chat one i just feel so hesitant typing because i cant keep up 
Sounds fun! Hope you have a great night and all goes well   currently this one and Hape Beast those look cool as well. Other than those just some small ones that pop up everyday
i lived very near gurney side . indeed a food heaven in penang. are you singaporean?
Well when your ona mision sometimes that happen it had happen to me  before
Cave 1 is rough business. eyes dont move that fast 
Thats right bro. Need a healthy and rested mind to focus! Its needed in this NFT  world too. So much happening! Especially as its all electronically based too your eyes get sore after a while
yh every cave is amazing in this community
U are here to ask u know the answer 861687609490276382
oh my gosh man how did i find this so late i am usually so early lol this is so asesome man. i hope i can buy secondary like it isnt priced out of reach
you blink and you dont know where your chat is in cave 1 7529KEKW
cave 1 is just very congested thats why i prefer cave 2
appreciate it brother 4890RicardoSmile
LOL naah i always played on a crappy handmedowns equipment and i recently built my pc for val in 2020 but i solely played minecraft. yeah tbh i just aim train for my games but isnt it a bit late for learning tap strafe? i thought they were removing it soon
Im hoping we build a strong foundation for this community with diamond hands and healthy vibes
Yeah same here ! Hahaha you tend to spend your whole day here and get side tracked
community is already strong! only up from here
yeah thats so true i feel like i need new prescription ahahhahha
i just want to see green so bad
lmao. bro too much love on discord. she needs some too. haha. great to see you back on fam but forreal get some rest too.. I was out today for the most part.
Yeah sometime you focus to much and for get things
most of my chats today are from cave 2 probably dance3
Cave 1 is for meth and crackheads. Cave 2 is chill like coke. Yall already know the winner
Youre early bro! The community is only going to keep growing! And there is still plenty of WL spots to get!

Yes very minimal spam too. I love that its all about quality and the moderators make sure of it. Each and every person who has a WL spot is so deserving of it

Yo bro we just enjoying the vibe here!
This is likely the chat speed post launch guys
Everyone please spread the news and invite your friends and familieand suggestions comment on nft youtubers to cover this
i feel that i did the same thing i dont even dislike streaming but i never wanna start streaming
man my first build had a 4790k just recently upgraded to a 11700k since it was on sale i wanted to go with amd one but it was out of stock earlier this year
Thanks fam!! I picked up a gold mom the other day for a good price. How many dads do you have?
i see i see tbh i feel like its fun streaming off stream but i guess i never got used to it
streaming is fun especially when toxic ppl join ur chat
Good to see cave 2 poppin even with no exp on 
Simple straightforward roadmap has me hyped!!! Lets go!!
Hahaha we about to have a litty time
Loved Kaijus but they are too expensive RN so im really happy to get these wyverns
love the first one haha always a good time
Fingers did not get the message
yea if u put ur twitch in ur name or something youll always have a bunch of toxic kids come in ur chat lmao
Haha thanks bro! Nice kid see ghost pfp too bro
built mine like way back  had some plans of upgrading but i dont really do anything that requires the extra manpower tbh
Just 2 Jealous AF tho lol Did dad rarity have anything to do with the mom you got?
yes these will be big like the kaijus though these are sick yo!
what do you usually use ur pc for nowadays?
Any cw caves will be great caves
its dope fun and getting engaed with ur chat
cave 1 got nothing on cave 2 ez
AYYEE now were talkin. Nothin like that peak when u all in yo feelings. Dont forget a gum for all that grindin LOOL
Yeah lets hope so. Hopefully no rain. 
Hapebeast looks nice but man its crazy in there. Seems whitelist will be a lot harder to get in.
i went crazy in amsterdam hahaha u can get it legally there its crazy
Just regular browsing  here and there with video games not too heavy on video games. I did used to edit photosvideos but havent been too into photography for a bit.
yeah facts sometimes i have really bad mental with my games and i tilt sometimes LMAO i just dont wanna show it
my friend dont get me started on what happens in amsterdam
Congrats getting WL again bro. How did yiu feel when u got WL?
im thinking bout going to amsterdam next year whould u say its worth the money on the distric and cafes if u know what i mean ez
RIGHTT!! Same! You can legally carry 5 pills on you there. Any more than that you can get packed. Thats where we bought our drugs when we went to tomorrowland
cave 2 seems much better than cave 1 haha
Not bad fam. May play a factor when getting tots later on.
Is the slow mode different here?
hahaa i agree i like cave 2 a lot moree better convos for sure in here
what happens in amsterdam stays in amsterdam
Spain theres no better place to exploe than amsterdma i can only recommend and the red district goes crazy hahahahah
yeah but its a free follow and viewer
what happens in amsterdam is forgotten in amsterdam literally
i have always wanted to go to amsterdam
What do you mean buddy? Slow mode means 1min cd before next chat
yeah i think so too the leaders are strong. I bought CryptoZombiez to be able to hold fractional kaijus. It will be even greater if i can hold of of these wyverns though
Hahahah Coke  seems like we need to go Amsterdam
they dont even do weed there anymore that stuff is boring to them that shows the night life is very fun there
ay thats good make ppl watch u haha
thats all i need to know kek  looks like me and my boys going to amsterdam
he wont be the only coke in amsterdam
Just gonna try and get one off mint devoted more time to this project 
thoughty2 Dude honestly I didnt even know what happened. I was so surprised and thank you! httpsdiscord.comchannels902798623744618516902811796732260362903499571139842048  when I got WL

My man good to see you in the chat fam. No exp got nothing on us. hahaha. the vibe here is just too great. How are you doing todaytonight?
yea facts when i use to stream i use to tilt on stream all the time and thats how i got most of my exposure ngl
nice do you think it matters if I go for intel or amd for my processor?
i recommend renting an airbnb with the boys and go crazy for a week thats what i did and it was the best time i ever had
Nice thats cool do you like living there
i say go with amd more bang for your buck plus extra cores
Bro amazing. Feeling the excitement for u still
What was your rank at that time do you remember?
Yes my plan as well. Not trying to deal with the server atm. Gotta save up some eth for next month. haha
Omg HAHAHA thats so cool  deffs on the list! 
Phil  Wyvern  lmao hahaha yeah not the only Coke there
i heard airbnb facing a financial problem ? dont know legit or not
Really thats the question you gonna ask a guy named Coke. Lmao
forsure what case would you recommend me? I was thinking of lian li or maybe nzxt? idk anything ab building pcs and have been looking around online
Coke idk man u could really like cola
honestly bro i am not a big pc guy i could not answer that   building my entire pc was a trek and a half  basically consulted like my entire friend group 
Hey Im doing alright got soaked in the rain today tho. Hbu?
sounds like a plan my boys were planning to go somewhere in europe next year anyways and amsterdam checks ever box on our list
Ngl its actually the best ! Wouldnt want to be anywhere else !
thoughty2 Somewhere around low 70s I believe! Was just chillin having a good time and got blessed.
Peter T. hahaha I feel that! Trying to stay as liquid as possible while investing in good projects
I mean peep my pfp fam theres yo hint hahahahahha
rkm you def needa go!! Buy yo drugs there if u visting tomorrowland hahahaha the popo be in the festival snoopin sellin
oh shit idk how i missed that  LOOOL
any difference cave  and cave 2?
Thats my approach too. Help build this community and invite more people and spread the news
caleb sheesh good luck with your build! i love the lian li cases so clean. just make sure u do ur own research and see if u could find anything better for the same price
be careful at night tho crazy shit goes down there!
Cola and coke  HAHA sounds like a good combo !
Oo tough. Where from? Doing good fam. Just watching one of my favorite card breaker on yt and chilling in here. Up to anything fam?
LOOL understandable cause chat goin hard
IYKYK Clean the grind is worth it 
What time zone are u at right now
i bet there will be pick pockets that target tourists and people high but my boys be out here   from nyc aint no one ready to test us
Phil  Wyvern sounds like itll fizz 
Does this make discord your full time job? Those hours! 
i wonder how are difficult it is to draw dragons
Ngl when u hit that bump and ya whole throat be numbin an ice cold cola would be fkin bomb
Whats the difference with cave 1 and 2
nothin wrong w some fizzy coke 
Just want to give a little input if you dont mind. Can we have thecave3 maybe? The growth is unbelieveable and sometimes its kinda hard to have a conversation with the famas its moving so fast especially during exp hour. I believe this will help in community communication and built better relationship among us.
facts cave 2 is better its less busy and chat does not go extremely fast at the speed of light
Yeah gotta pick and choose the good projects. Cant ape in projects that arent going anywhere.
nvm if ur from nyc ur prepared hahahah
Cave 2 is just better but I hop around and talk to everyone I can!
thoughty2 Thank you! Really appreciate that  Spend time here get to know people help others out and stay active and sure enough you effort will get noticed! And Im EST.
Peter T. Have a few to chose from though some are better than others for sure!
VX dragon must be very nice to use in meta lol
im getting lunch soon but i have no clue what to get either
Cave three is so needed. Its gunna get a lot of hype being so fresh to begin with
dat legend hahahaha what a name
Whats the diff between all these chats? kekw
Stay tuned for all the tabs haha
Not sure but giveaways happen every few hours
Sharing what I shared in the main chat I just want to take a moment to comment on how brilliant this team is. Now I have been involved in a few projects over the last couple of months and this is the first time I am commenting so hard and engaging so many people in the hopes that I can get into the the whitelist. I am not sure if this is what the team is intending to do but trust me when and if I get my whitelist and mint this amazing piece of art no way I am selling this easily. I have invested hours and hours and hours into this community. I am definitely going to stay not so say I am a paperhand havent sold a single nft that I owned so far and like for real there is this attachment to the team here now! I see so many familiar names I know which part of the world they come from what food they like to eat what they do outside in real life. This is crazy stuff man really!
sushi ramen? or subway if you have that around you i could give you my order!
Infintrus love u sexy sleep well

oh yes i was on topshot way before I got on the other NFTs. I still buy the packs. Have a lot that arent even open yet too. Hoping i can sell them later on which i think theyre working on implementing soon.
elias yeah held onto it ever since it came out. Waiting on the psa to open back again so I can get it graded. Sweet I need to get the new charizard. also need to pick up the ultra premium set too. Sweet modern sports card i have mostly modern too. Hobby is so expensive nowadays so i try to get into breaks instead. you should try it sometimes.
No problem! Happy to help here.
How is everyone doing guys? Feeling great ? Make sure to get enough rest and always stay hydrated boyzzz
So people can have time to take a break and spend time with fam and make sure people get a break mentally from grinding levels and stuff
bro im waiting for cave 4 to open up...  so i can bring my girl into there 
HAHAHAH damn cant help it  I got fans
yeah oh well. More opportunities in the future haha
Peter T. yeah I just ripped the ultra premium collection actually haha. Had to get my hands on the 2 gold cards theyre actually super sick in hand. And thats crazy man I hope your zard comes back as a 10. Would be an insane come up.
Ooo nice one haha have a great day everyone 
Yall need secret cave or some shit
rkm i thought u said u got onlyfans lmao i read that wrong
Thats the best way to look at it honestly. Were so early still
love the heat! im a big dwade fan so most of my cards are all dwade. fox is nice for sure
nah cave 4s private for just rkm and i baby
Yeah everyone is super enthusiastic here! Which is great because we are build a community here!
exactly man I keep telling everyone that. I just put my dad onto crypto and a little bit of nfts. Cant wait to see what the scene is like in a year
I had eggs with avo and toast ! Was a beauty !!
looking like its going to  be a solid bluechip. must not be slept on.
man this is the coolest project out
alright well i chatted here none stop since xp went down time to get some sleep. gn people.
Great as usual! Grinding on my business now
What about yourself ? Anything  yum

Thank you bro! You are green too! Congratulations!!!
I cant contain my excitement really
nah bro sleep is for the smart! You need to rest and look after your healthy
timmGo read up on the chats you lost this one buddy
Make sure you guys check announcements ! Chance at a WL spot
awesome fam!! I need to grab two of those. hold one and rip one. the gold metal cards are freaken sick!! My zard is not gonna get a 10 forsure. maybe a 67 the most. I was handling it when i was a kid. lol. gonna hold onto it forever.
DNGYN sweet!! dwade cards will go up soon. Future HOF gonna make his cards shoot up. so make sure to stock up right now. yeah i need to grab more fox card too.
nah i wont waste my time reading some soft boy love talk
Yoo that actually sounds so yum !!
Yes you have done it!!! Congrats!
Yes! Be friendly within the community
ah i see. Even then it would be insane to even hold a base set zard in my hands at all. Hope it comes back with the best grade it could get man. Cheers
Argh. UPC is the one thing from celebrations I couldnt get my hands on. Think theyll reprint?
Probably but even if you cant get your hands on them for retail still worth paying secondary imo! Or at the very minimum just buying the gold cards directly from secondary. Such nice pieces imo. A must have
these wyverns remind me of dragonites

I did one year in highschool for fun with my friends and ended up liking it. Now I throw for leisure. The way the disc rolls off your hand is so weird because its similar to how a bowling ball should release from your hand  but from the side and using momentum to keep it in place when winding up

nice there are more little towns or cities
Its the best in summer ! Beaches are so nice then
Same here man!!!! I really cant wait and the yu gi oh vibe just keeps getting me excited
Okay I dunno what that means lmao
Winter season has arrived in India
This. Im really liking the smaller mint size on some of these newer projects. Helps with retainment and community engagement
I saw someone sharing a list of upcoming good nft. So went for a research among them. Found that this is the best. No invite competition.
chicken is good it would be great
Imagine having 100 unique holders. This is something that will be so good
Oh get ready for a cold winter HAHA
We dont have seasons here in Malaysia 
Especially with the WL and one per mint
Yeah. Some project is a hold bro. Mostly organic one. All depends on the dev team.
Dont need to sleep on cave 2 cause its trash
Malaysia bro. What time rn in your country?
 just got here not long ago! How is everyone doing in here
Man thats not how you spread positivity. You can get out of here now and move to you cave
I am from the philippines but i live in Canada lol.. 122am here now HAHA

Ugh. Yea I suck at invite WL stuff. I dont even bother. Those projects have been tanking recently anyway.
Andy12 Wyverns yep helps keep that floor up. Lets go 100x
No problem happy to help around here
Cave 2 always holding it down. Yall the GOAT.
Completely agree gas is always disgustingly expensive  ! If we can avoid gas wars that would be awesome
Hahaha I wonder how many ppl from NYC in this chat
Gas wars still here tho while shitcoins are running
Haha seems like you are favoring cave 2 quite a bit! Does it have a particular reason?
Im from Canada bro hehehe it snows crazy here. Also I have a lot of indian friends here too. I eat a lot of indian food too chicken tika masala chai? manggo lassi? Garlic naan etc. Cheese paneer is my favorite
Its our norm here. Electric bill is insane 
Cave 1 2 or 3. Always remember we are all family in here. We are all winner. We are one big community
Heyyy a familiar face !  how are you doing mate ?
Until it becomes a competition!
Facts man every cave is an awesome cave and no need to compare because we are all in this together building a good community.
Laksa is good tho. I bet is not easy to get in Canada?
Cave 2 and 3 and for sure better than Cave 1
Friendly competition is always a nice thing! Motivates a lot of people i feel
thats actually sick af you and your homie forsure got the best costume idea i seen so far no cap
Yes bro really hard We had to wait for 6 years to get in here. But my mom was already here tho. But still hard.
Hello Cave 2 friends wanted to debut some wyvern emojis fan love that I made. Please thumbs if you enjoy my collection! currently on Legendary Lightning Wyvern

Yea for sure there are so many people from NYC
Best of luck to ya fellow new Yorker

Cave 2 is winning the race no matter what
Maybe a few but theres def alot from NY
Yea haha we know what its like to work at this point
I am great! I really love these engaging projects its an awesome way to show support
Not that long actually just joined recently and getting to know the community 
Lets go guys!!! Almost 10k members time to build this community to the max
Definitely. That will be another story of your life to tell and you learn to appreciate what you have
hahaha seems like i have more interactions in here than the other cave but theyre all great.
same too! might change my pfp to wyvern
hey everyone new here! cant wait for this project already loving the vibes
Thats crazy. We were just at like 4k when I joined..... yesterday!
Doing great bro  how are you today! great to see your name here
i have make a meme for the community check it bros memes
For sure  hope we can all have a great time here
Cool man. Do I know you from another project?
Lets show why we are the best cave. Lets show who we are. Show them how polite we are
Damn bro its only up from here! On the way to 100K for sure
This project looks great as well 
Not much fren to invite most of the time. Share on those shill channels and no one coming in  not able to WL sucks haha 
Just checked it looks awesome man
 ! Yeah it seems pretty lively here but i havent checked the other caves just yet so its hard to compare
That would be great well be part of the dragon family  if wyverns are considered that D
Awesome bro! Keep up the great work
haha pick and choose or chat in all three.
thanks bro we are going to do it we have a lot of chances
Strongest community member was in cave 2
Yeah i like that similar to kongz they value people that support the project and want to build a nice community
daddyC  Cave2 Wyvern  yup! Totally sucks. But then some of those projects arent even worth it unfortunately.
egg tart congratulations on the green bro  much deserved
Yeah man that is the correct way to go 
Keep checking announcements guys! theres plenty of giveaways contests and official talk on the project for WL opportunities. Hope everyone has a lovely day!
Yooooo egg tart CONGRATS ON THE GREEN FAM! You just welcomed me awhile ago jeeeez
its doable with the timer. haha
No way haha i think just being in one already takes a lot just to keep track of all the conversations
all caves are great but rage is the best channel
I keep swapping between cave 1 and 2
Yes sir check announcements and whitelistinfo this helped me awhile ago
Yeah there is  ! Still early stages  have fun here mate
every cave is a safe place to stay and enojy
Cant keep up on cave 1 honestly hahahahaha. Cave2 chill vibe
Chat is super slow  cant even interact properly
Most of the project can say.  cause invites with bots and so on. No interaction in the chat. And community dies out
I know Coke is there lol hahahaha i love the vibe their too
I suppose so. Still a bit hard to keep track of everything though
Hey mods if youre reading this just wanted to say thank you for making us actually engage in chats and not making us just reach a level. Having actual convos with people instead of just seeing spam so just wanted to say thank you!
cave 1 is wayyyy too spammy cave 2 and 3 are the best
Some guys told me its 60secs before they changed to 30s
Looks awesome man!!!!!!! Cant wait for the actual release actually
yeh bro cant wait to see the different variations
Thats true! Other discords where i went they just saying lfg and wagmi LMAAAAAAO
Hey community !!! All the best to everyone !
Hey man thank you for that awesome words bro
 its alright! Just gotta chill and take your time
Exactly. Didnt go to cave3 as heres best for me
Yea. Some dead discords after mintreveal. Some projects be tweeting how they all organic growth and Im like broooooo you just made me invite like 5 people
hi to the new cosmic wyverns  my name is babony and i will give up a little ride through the server 
and i think you would ask about wl here is the info whitelistinfo 
some recommendations be active and helpful we arent here to spam we are here to engage and enjoy bros 
keep checking giveaways and triviaquiz  could be great opportunities 
Dont fell in scam check officiallinks  and scamalert
The mod would never contact you 
if you have any question just ask me im here to help
HAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHA Coke Cave been sniffing it white 
 someone please go look at my meme
Yeah man super slowed  have to Work simultaneously
When its about drug coke is always there to join
I use the search method to keep track of all my conversations. Thatll help a lot. 
Fellow members if you want to track your conversations use the search method and type in your username and all comments will be seen. That way you dont scatter looking for responses.
Its better the be 5. More interactive. But heres come the problem. Spamming of the chat
I think its because the first cave goes really fast  but cant say for sure since i only got here recently too
the most recent sneak peak is by far my favorite
15 seconds is cool it was a minute earlier so
Haha  most of the group are. Too many projects coming soon
This cave is super cool and nobody is spamming
Like this one I feel like I wanna meet people others im like bruh
30 seconds is actually good no spamming
Yeah man ! I 100 agree haha reminds me of charizard and i love it
Thanks for the great advice  will start using this
Nah thats very helpful but sometimes when the discord has 39349440 members its so confusing and messy since its always moving
Nice PFP! I just grabbed a bunni today
Yeah its really nice i hate the lfg and wagmi spams so this is much welcomed
Its hard when youre using phone discord 
Between oversaturation and insane gas ETH projects not selling out unless they got true blue chip potential
Yea man!!! When and they asked me to invite like 10people and im like.. bruh im new to discord i have 0 friends hahahahahaahahahahaha. They were like post it on other discord. Then i just left lmao
Chat was still flying with that minute delay though
I can see animations in the sneak peak is everyone getting motion type NFTs ?
look way better than majority of projects being released. I love the pixel art and wyverns are awesome
Thats only for cave 1 right? Or cave 2 and 3 are flying as well
Yeah have seen a lot projects struggle right now! Unfortunate timing for a lot of them this week
YESSS THE FRIENDS PART HAHAHA I feel like all us nft ppl understand having no friends
Bro is that junglefreaks? Looks awesome
Yea im talking about cave 1 earlier
this is the one of the best projects bro
I think thats just for the legendaryunique types that are 11s
Yes sir!!! Hahahaah pretty sure nft peeps has no friends in their discord or is it just me. Wahahahah
Yes brother Im an OG in jungle freaks! Community and team is insane and diamond hands 
what is friend word you are talking about
Hahaha nah bro I gotchu. Im add you if you need Invited i gotchu. Hope you got me back haha. Were friends now bro
Insane gas is the biggest issue right now for project not to be slow minted out.
Ah.. thats why I moved to cave 2. Pace is not too slow not too fast
Oh no I thought whole collection will get similar types 
Wow seeing a few familiar faces
Same cave 2 and 3 are much better than cave 1 imo
Yup noone likes to pay 0.20.3 eth gas when mint is just 0.05
Hahaha yeah bro Idek where I got that word from
Lots of struggling projects and the huge hacks this week. People definitely gonna be more selective with their 
Yes sir!!! Youre gonna be my first friend here actuallt hahahaha. Also i like your magic mushroom pf
Hi Pman Im just joined few hours ago
your name reminds me of mr pinkman aka jesse pinkman from breaking bad
Thanks bro. Yeah bunni is nice hop hop. Myb gonna scoop up some more soon after the gas drop
I avoid such gas ! Can spend between 50200 max not much just for transaction
Thank u bro! How long u been in the nft space then?
Haha  i wish ! But that seems very unlikely tbh  gotta make things special for the unique types
I love memes! It always give me a positive vibe
Oh yeah! Lol... Its been a few years since I watched that.
Yeah 2050 jacked up is insane. Thats why we are now in the winter market. Cold out here
I havent been to cave 3 actually. I just hoop my way into cave 2  
So people usually stick to the same cave here?
Thats why I love discord man. Really have common interest with ppl all over the word even when IRL u got none of those lol. We boys now haha
Gnite Cave 2. This kids gotta be put to bed. See ya in the morning
I can under that in what other projects are you into?
Im tempted. I love that art style. Super clean and cute
quality show ay timwhothy yeh memes make the world vibe round
Haha keep chatting with me and get to know me and maybe that word wont be so foreign to us 
Yesss sir hahahahahaha finally man! Ok ill see you tomorrow bro! Sleep time
Yeah but thats completely reasonable a lot people just waiting for gas to slow down and get back to minting ! Id expect people to go crazy again once gas dies down
are you from india And where am I from India?
sounds gewd ive seen your pfp around what project is that?
Gas be going crazy last few days
Hey guys myb we can settle out home base here in cave 2. All of us here. Haha  myb change our server name to Cave2 Wyvern

I think this is where we explore everything from the perspective of duality 
Right now i am in bearx hor1zon and imxkongz  love these a lot
I guess im hoping between cave 2 and 3 but i saw some people say theyre sticking with there cave
Stay healthy guys !! See you shortly
Read up the roadmap as well. Good thing ahead.
Its the magic mushroom clubhouse and yeah bro gas is insane. I just wanna mint something rn and Im waiting to gas. 100 the new 60 I guess
Nice! I prefer nonduality but to each their own fam.
For sure. This one looks legit.
damn yeh i remember when i came into the nft game like 3 months ago high gas was like 40 rip
All these are imx projects? BearX got hacked several people lost their money
Rarebunni is the name haha  or do u mean is my bunni rare?
maybe some people here bro singapore
Anyone like my thanos take on wyverns?
Im gonna checkout cave 3 later on. How long have u been in this server?
where are you from and ate your food
Malaysian here. Theres a singapore channel myb check it out
No just imxkongz is on layer2 and yeah the hack was unfortunate but the community decided to increase mint price and compensate the victims
Hows the community treating you

yeh bro word. ive learnt to stop fomoing to projects cause ive got so much money locked up into nfts just cause i fomod haha. This one i know will be worth it tho plus i pretty much live on discord and i am happy i found a place to chat to genuine people rather than just going wagmi back and forth.
Please give some love to my fan art its a batik wyverns fanart
Get vaccinated and avoid public gathering
defs do bro this is a community based project they arent just tryna sell they want to build a strong community filled with genuine people thats why i like it
My husband love McD and thats the only suggestion I get from him when ordering food online 
hi bros im expecting you are having a good night i make another memes  hopefully you like it
Already meeting some genuine one now so I can see that for sure
I left after I couldnt find my convo.  it takes more time to scroll than actual typing
Hahah I can understand that but try let me him eat something like MacD but a healthier verison
Yeah Ive also fomo far too much.. my portfolio look like a mess 
Brother its level has increased so much that Now it has become very difficult Its hard to even get a number in this

Haha sorry I was just kidding. Its in India .
Lets blow up Twitter to 10k guys
I have been there since last 1 hour it is from this morning so far I or my rank is not even 1 big
Dumb question but does talking in the other channels besides the cave get taken into consideration? Lol
just grabbed lunch and the little hatchling is back however everyone
Oh we are in the same city. Thats amazing! Yeah the cases is def fake as the death cases are rising each day but confirmed cases are decreasing. 
Hmmm nice question but only MagnusDrake can answer this 
XPs are not coming I guess they stopped it for today
I heard there is vegetarian menu for McD in India is that true? Other healthier options which he doesnt like  that give me headache
A green head told me theyre always watching  so we good haha
Good to hear that. What you do?
covid has change many lives some to bad some to good

Dont rest here its done today Too many people are growing in this Its too hard to be green in this now
Exactly! We have vegetarian menu here. Veg menu includes tomato onion potato stuffed tikki which tastes good
I guess Ill just stick to cave 2 at this moment than. Since there isnt a channel for my country

But we are not getting any of those spots at the moment 
going great my man. hows your Friday coming along brother?
Ikr. maybe we can meet more friends from same country if there is a channel for our own country. But thats how I meet u 
Yeah all around the world get affected. Our government dont even care to lock down anymore even we are thousands cases each day just within a city.
Keep going mate! The mods and team here is very active and they will take note of folks who are contributing!
Lots of it  let us all work for it
Live with it.  there is nothing else you can do

You dont mind if I use your template hehehe
Ikr sound scary but at least our states Gov doing their best to give out vaccine. About 8088 vaccinated tho

I have been active in the community for the last 2 days or so  when I first joined the community we had around 4K members and we have already doubled in less than 48 hours!One tip is to try to be helpful build a relationship with people and have good conversation with the people! I think the team appreciates genuine conversation rather than just canned responses. The mods and team are always around so if you are contributing and adding value to this space it will be noticed and rewarded  This is how I managed to get into the whitelist a couple of hours 3 or 4 hours ago. Very excited about this and I will be rooting for you bro! Will be here to congratulate you when your name turns green too

Im considering trying to pull my rare zombie for sale and just holding it for a bit and buying another just to have on hand

we dont need no xp to get us active we all just wanna be frens
Anyone know how big this collection will be?
Yeah if not the chat would go loco
Remember Devs will never DM you about anything! If you do its a scam and block immediately stay vigilant
Its to spread out the chats so that theyre less congested it makes it easier to chat with people because chat isnt moving as fast PESSalute
Didnt they have one for pirated movies too? Made it seem like you were about to go to maximum security

haha bro i wish i could make my own strain and name it after myself
Great. Whats you re going to have for dinner
Jokes on them I aint got an eth
what would be the name of your strain?

Nameless Nope I am new to NFTs pretty much kind of FOMO newbee learning here.
I mean.... best sex ever smoke? lmfaoooo
oh sweet as I love eating the korean fried chicken its the best
Sandycheeks hahahaa thats a good one 
sorry i guessed because your name Ng sounds like a cantonese last name. but anyway it is nice to meet you my fellow asian brother
Im a season 4 bronze LMAO I havent done ranked almost ever
having high hope for this project!
Its okayyy mate. And I do know how to speak cantonese. hahaha
damn man! might be grinding the wrong thing! allgood nothing wrong with being bronze. some of my friends are bronze and they have the greatest mentality! keep it up chrisb
For real if I make it in that whitelist Im gonna make that leap
I just want something as unique as this one love me some low supply projects and when the art is as nice as this one honestly gonna be great
yes! malaysian are soooo talented in languages! i have a friend who can speak 4 languages omg
Of course thats more of an experience I had on it and not the smoke lmao. Super tingly body high real relaxing
yea bro good luck man i hope you get it!
I dont like to give projs floor prices cuz I feel its toxic but what you just mentioned will make it go very high
used to every night but got this bad side affect from my first dose of phizer vax so havent had for like over a month
Hahahaha. I know 4 languages also. Chinese Malay English and Cantonese. But my Cantonese is not good tho.
Yeah I dont like talking about floor I feel like that breaks up a community and project. When everyone is talking about the floor then you know no one is there for the long haul
I was daily for like 3 years until I went back home from college and got caught lmao now I get super paranoid sometimes yet still went through 8 wax pens recently hahaha
Not yet but going to. Waiting the project to launch the date
see! thats what i mean! sooo talented bro! btw i hope SG friends wont hate me but i prefer malay style bak ku teh 
doing great bro you just joined us in the wyvern den?
Yoyo. Love your nickname pal hahahaha
I was going HAM on URF with xin zhao had so much fun infinitely diving in haha
hahaha sounds like your parents are against it. I used to get paranoid of getting caught when i was 16 but luckily when i hit 18 they stopped caring
HAHHA is ur username ur real name ?
sorry guys i feel like ive turned this into a stoner chat lmao
Fun fact they are but they also pay for my brothers weed and he smokes every 2 hours... medical reasons are a great excuse Im just an espresso depresso lmfao
no worries love to have a stoner sess talk
all good bro! i only smoked a few times in my life before but i have tried DMT which is supposed to be hardcore according to my friends
I think theres more participation than complaining you gucci hahaha
Thanks bro hahaha. Youve tried bak ku teh before? Taste very good right? I just ate it on Tuesday. Damn nice
whats up wyverns fam how yall doing ?
Yep I hate that so much when people just care about that and only talk about floor sweeping. Thats a major red flag for me 
oh nah we vibin needed another stoner
Battle Factions IMX. Ive got their whitelisted. Just need to wait their announcement
Extreme red flag every other project Ive been part when they start to talk about floor Ik its going downhill from there
damnnn ive always wanted to tried furthest ive gone is shrooms in that stuff. leonardodabitchi Chrisb960 in that case lfg 
i have it very often! there is a malay bak ku teh place in Hong Kong owned by malays so good!
i swear weed just brings everyone together. still cant believe its illegal in some places blows my mind
when was the last time yall smoke!
psychedelics really is very different i used it for the medical value though i have depression and anxiety  it helpe me a lot
Yessir many project can overcome that but it all depends
yeah so much stigma but they starting to legalize it more
Focus too much on your baseline and you cant journey into the future unknown
month ago due to health reasons haha but before that every damn day
yeah and people are in jail for it crazy. weed deff lets me see how people move and their vibes
im good! howre you friend. are you new to the Wyverns den?
Damn you make that up on your own ?
yeh man shrooms are soooo therapeutic fam i wanna try microdose
WAGMI! Lets grind together family and all get WL!! Great community keep it up everyone
I thought it was kinda clever so please dont be sarcasm T.T haha
Nah no sarcasm here lol sorry if it came out that way
yeh defs making progress happy to see
yeah agree. im loving this community the moment i got in. its different here
For the new comers who are curious about WL  just try to be helpful show off your art and keep an eye out on giveaway theres still plenty of WL spots left
Why are there 3 different chats?
yea i wanna do regular microdose as well. you should check out on youtube michael pollen  a very knowledgeble professor on this topic
i once took shroom and almost passed out at the register at wendys xd
Yeah you are so right! we are a different breed here
Because even with slow mode it moves too fast for one chat
yeah we the wyverns fam flying to the moon bro 
Lol alright anyways GN bro and GN everyone in cave 2 enjoy the rest of your nights
goodnight bro! have a good rest see you in a few hours
The spread the load! It can be super overwhelming when there are a lot of people typing in the same chat!
I see. People must be spamming chat like crazy
Have a good nite rest catch u later sleepingpepe
the grind is real here. glad to be part of this community 
first time taking shrooms i was at the snow with one of my homies. we went to this place for food and on our way to the registor we just burst into laughter and had to get out of there was so funny haha
No grind just love the community! And this amazing project

You know what else does? You guys. My bluetooth flew off my helmet on the freeway today goodbye music. I encountered my first Karen IRL she called the sheriff on me over a rock... But yall making me not care what happened before haha
Please make sure you get some sleep 2 hours at least. Avoid those micro sleep when driving

Fews more hours till work ends hehe
when my friend told me time in NFT land is a lot faster i didint believe him but YES it is lol
water tastes amazing after a meal i can down like 23 glasses i swear
but when i come back to HK I gotta quarantine for 21 days... i think i might go crazy.....
yes time flies wayyyy too fast in this space
dont mind that too ngl. most of the time i ask for medium rare it comes medium well haha
for sure i might plan to pull an all nighter once again image0
Dont gotta work tomorrow so the only driving I have to do is maybe take my bike to a shop to get my brake fluid changed lmao
i get full off of drinking water after every bite i eat lmaoo
so glad I came across this project today

For those wondering on how to check rank just head over to the verify channel and type in !rank

yea its actually better cos you dont have people who are just chatting to level  you can feel it
lmaooooo what a guy u not wrong
4.5 but its more like a mom van with custom upgrades lmao
Just a reminder that XP has been turned off so if youre not seeing your rank go up its because they have turned off any XP gain when messaging
yeah i said this earlier doesnt feel like a chore
I am asking your level pay rank You have to come in the rank of 200
my name is Sandy nice to meet u alex image0

This project is looking promising

U 2 man  777  SARKAR  thx man u2 we gonna make it 
Brother the mods are watching but choosing carefully
they deff are watching bro dont worry lol i have faith
Cave 2 gives us a chance to get to know each other Ive been having too much fun here to go anywhere else
Yeah! The same happened with my Alpacadabraz the gas was too high because some heavy hitters were minting a lot and I couldnt find any way to get it at low fast but I still went for it because I know that its going to be a genuinely great project in the future.
The cave 1 is actually going so fast you cant properly read every comment !
0.05th youcan read more at faqs
Still early u nid work hard more XD
yeah true but its sometimes managable haha

If I get waitlist Im buying more eth instantly lmao
oh boy you guys really are always watching

Nothing much bro! Im just chilling right now. Whatd I miss so far in the chat? Anything interesting happening?
How is everyone? whos super excited for this project I know I am
Good my man! Haha how about yourself? Man this slow mode is a killer! 
hahaha thats what i mean well deserved!
Theyre the ones making thousands they got in earlier than me lmao so I guess Im the one using them D
haha need WL for good projects. Thats for sure
lol its okay its all apart of the grind. 
thats a dedication right there! Well deserved
Deserved  u were on demon mode 
You still gotta let me know which cave I should run to to save myself from the slow mode bro
hahahaha nah not if u were still riding w them before the fact? i told u 3 brooo haha
Guys dont worry just in a matter of time. If you keep this vibe going. You will be rewarded. But dont forget that we are all winner here no matter what happen
Ima be on demon mode too. I gotta grind!!!
Oh shit I see it now hahaha I didnt notice cause it was the only time we didnt reply or  each other hahaha
is there a difference between caves chat ?
Is there a roadmap for this project?
tysm everyone ! appreciate u guys Im sending goodlucks to those who have engaged in quality convos here PESHeart
na just for people to chat more because lots of slow mode in between chats haha
Been here since 500 I just got run out of luck and missed the OG role but all in all. I love the spirit here the positivity is amazing
thanks yoms! im taking that luck from you unapologetically hahahaha
yes compared to cave 1 for sureeee
Most of the time once I type out my message I only have to wait a few more seconds but talking to multiple people can be a pain
being helpful in chat thats what im into atm
absolutely can actually talk lol
Chillin in the cave going out for some golf later and you ? 
good today I just woke up and you ?
might just have to continue this grind tomorrow
slept well? ready for another big NFT day?
just shaking off sleep grabbing some coffee. came to see everyone chillin in the cave
We werent supposed to grind today though 
So whats so good about cave 2 compared to the other caves? I know theres no difference but what are your reasons to talk in here  not the others?
damnn u calling it quits? Isnt it like 5 am for u? KEKW
dunno im just used to talk here more than cave 1 hhahaa
im just sad that i didnt get into this group earlier...
fine bro just got home from work
hahaha lets goooo! good to hear youre ready
be careful of any DMs saying wyverns ready to mint. Newbie collectors fall for that but you guys are better than that. announcements has a warning bout it too

i help my homie run his business and store online most of the online stuff i handle like the webstore and the promotions but its pretty light compared to the money Ive made from nfts. Its just something to say I do as a job ya know instead of saying i have jpegs online worth thousandsKEKW

Brother what did you even do for so long
cave 2 gang lyfe! Kishu knows where its at!
Yeah bro. I saw two mushrooms pfp earlier but I couldnt recall the names 
Bro we just started opening up retail and gyms but we still have 1600 new cases daily 
need to skip around caves to see whats happening
Wow you stayed up so late?! Im about to bring my wife out for dinner soon
nothing really if only i knew about NFTs earlier it wouldve been a much more productive lockdown.
About i been here when the discord server has only 4k  people.
Honestly at this point... as much as I want to be part of this project this community is worth it regardless of getting on WL
the gym is defff needed i started doing workouts at home tho and just been buying stuff. obviously stopped since my stress fracture
i know right very good community here
Honestly same just started my journey not to long ago
Yeah. Quick and easy. I used to love carbonara but Im trying to cut off carbs from my diet. The pasta is only for my family members
i think many of us are not that old into nft
Thanks bro you can also do it bro. Just be active and help the people thats one the key.
Haha hows the scene in other caves? Ive only been in cave 2
just chillin gaming with the boys and then hopped back in the discord to see whats up! wow youre such a great husband what yall about to eat??
Maybe I should check out other caves too!
You never leave the cave buddy?  Its nice to have time sit down and chatting
Cave 2 is actually a much better place than Cave 1 because Cave 1 is full of fast messages.  Really not easy to hold any kind of conversation there!
Damn I looked at cave 1 for a second but its moving way too fast for me lmao
Yeh Ive got some weights gotta start doing home workouts been doing lots of cardio
New here. And happy to be here! Hope you guys doing good GWcmeisterPeepoLove
Im currently trying to chat in all caves atm
Yea Im a bit scared of msgs that get too fast I cant keep up haha
A good bench will go a long way too
Id ask to help as Mod but already theres so many. LFG strong team!
gonna leave soon haha WLCC l Febe 
jump rope is what gave me the stress fracture GBMM
pretty hard trying to maintain a conversation in chat 1...
Yeah right. I love the it with lots of sauce and cheese 
only thing im missing is a bench lol
Okie lemme do that. Goodnight BladeBK24 ! Have a good rest !
Yeah Im trying to get notice by the mods but no rush Ill get it hopefully soon
Hahaha yeh I gotta cut out carbs man
never said i was leaving now haha acfc but damn yall wanna kick me out now haha
Me too.  i only can keep up if its with my pc
If you dont wanna go full gym bench a piano bench could be decent enough without costing too much
But carbs taste good. Its not easy to resist haha
i just barely have room in my room
heard that it takes 23 days being active...
Whats your guys PB in bench press
Hahaha we all want you to get some rest buddy
i agree im glad i dont love to eat bread like some ppl do. i like bread just not how ppl eat it in one sitting and just keep eating idk
Bread makes you fat?! Who knows the quote?
Looks like Im going to be in this server for 23 days
Yeah. Thats literally the first dish I learn to make. Other than fried eggs and hotdogs
Someone just got a tattoo of the cosmic wyverns in art contest lol
In France we always dip our bread in sauce so ... yikes man
people really just rep a cave haha
ya we do that in the us too lol but ppl still eat bread without sauce... think it comes down to preference man not just where ur from lol
wait guys im confused why i my name color is different it wasnt like this yesterday
stay longer for the community bro enjoy your time.
That would be my daughter. Lol. She love breads which I dont get it. Its just plain carbs  But I like cakes
Make sure you guys know! DONT BUY ANY COLLECTIONS ON OS THEYRE ALL FAKE
Im hoping so! Ive been way more active today and there isnt even XP today haha but its lead to way better convo so Im vibing hard !
Wow its has grown so much organically just by 1 day? Its insane man
Hahaha nooooo I thought you mean you wanted to rest 
Now a french dip makes so much more sense.... lol
Yea sir only good conversations now
im more of a sweet tooth person myself haha icecream cookies
Dont worry the mods will stil recognise you! Keep grinding WAGMI
Yea otherwise its too intense. Cause me to panic lol slower pace is better for me lol
Do you guys like Doritos and French onion dip
goodafternoon guys how was your day?
Nice! Been a while since I chilled with my boys due to covid restrictions. Im about to eat some Chinese food. Soup base
Okok I know sleep is for the weak
I just had some japanese food for dinner D

Yeah Ill try it out when I go to sushi sushi again
Actually I just made 6 hard boiled eggs lol
cholestrol bro but go for it ahahahahaa
they have sushi sushi in tas? sickkkkk
Yeah man they are crowded but the thing is even if you grind somewhere else the devs keep watching us. Also you can join art and me if youre good about it
guys we have to be more carefull!!
 dont ever press any link from dm
 always see if the bot have check   in their profile to see if its a legit bot
 always use the official link FROM THE DISCORD CHANNEL
 buy a ledger or else you dont have to buy it but it is much safer if you have it
 some admin can be hacked too so always becarefull with some sus announcement
Yeah brother isnt like a iconic thing in Australia
Are all of the NFTs going to be animated?
Guess we are the same. Slow handed 
All my real freind tell me to shut up about NFTS looking for some like minded NFT buddies. Here is my twitter page. httpstwitter.comsteve72224907?t8lR4btCd6BnAVr6OGI78ws09
Non Fungible Gentlemen steve72224907
Boys whos down for a McDonalds run
I dont think that there are any tips other than just genuinely meet and help people as you chat lol
So it sounds like WL spots are hand picked by being active  helpful in the. community?
No worries brother anything as well
Its not for me  I dont really like eggs. But eggs doesnt seems related to cholesterol imo
just had a maccas run before burgers were a mess... as always.
woww!! were seeing alot of new blue ones ahhhh
What do you want from McDonalds
At this moment yeah. You can check whitelistinfo for more details on the various methods to get WL
Damn man thanks  WLCC l Febe I am not too sure abt that too man  just heard a lot of people say but everything in moderation I guess !!
GCB i dont think we have them in Australia
I miss the milkshake McD used to sell
Gives people a chance to spend time with their family instead of grinding xp in here all day
Boys I had kfc not too long ago and they forgot my wicked wings
Idk why but wicked wings sounds like a pizza hut item lmao
Ohhh sad to hear that but its pretty good  u can try it if there is any chance 
They gave the guys grinding for top 200 a day off to spend time with family and take some time for their mental health
Haha damn it its the weekend best time for me to grind with a fulltime job
Whats your kfc order Ill try and get it next time I go
Same but honestly Id rather get WL by just being me and helping people than forcing myself to grind for that top 200
Mmm I hear you! This is the most active Ive been so far but Im loving it Im having such awesome convos with people cause not everyone is just tryna level up
tyleeer wtf dude get some rest lmao catVibrate
Yeah people used to said egg yolk got lots of cholesterol. The best way is to keep everything in moderation. But you never get enough of sick nft 
its ok bro. a nice juicy wl will ease the pain for sure
Yeah man  I guess can eat the egg white as much as you want
Guys whats your favourite donut from krispy cream
Original glaze but like a dozen of them
Yeah. U doesnt see much people spamming around WGMI. It keeps the community better
I always order wrap in KFC  I love their wrap
Yeh I agree rly good for community to strengthen and grow naturally
Nice to see nft all changing to organic growth
Legend Jedi mind trick that shit
Strong community creats diamond hands
like my tattoo this is crazy!!!!!
singapore has so many delicious food  definitely a place that i need to travel to . Singapore restrictions on covid are really strict?
I think egg white and egg yolks are fine. I know someone who tries to eat 0 carbsday only consume eggs all day. But its not for me for sure 
I havent eat KFC for so longPepeHands
Yeah one egg a day I good for me man 
A good community keeps the project alive 
Agreed  diamond hands  strong project

You too brother take it easy! Keen to speak when you get back
Too many people talking at once even with slow mode so they made 3 caves so we can spread out 
its just to help slow down chat so people can have a convo
Anyone like the new Facebook name

Yes like finally! I was stuck at home for 4 to 5 months
wow thats good to know buddy are you vaccinated?

Curious if this chat is more manageable than the cave 1
Cave 2 is where the cool kids hang
nice good to know that i think here in the philippines its half of the country are vaccinated
I think I waste 1 hour a day in jam man
Should visit Gold Coast in Brisbane
Malaysia bro is KFC having spicy flavor chicken over there?
in my area we can go out but the local mcdonal limited the variety of the food we only have 1 type of buger atm 
i think soon it will be 100! then we will all be safe fromcovid !
Bro we having double down burger now man  you tried it?
Yea. Hoping to visit aus again after covid is over. Last time I went there was like 20 years ago. Hahaha
i miss melbourne T.T im happy they r opening their borders slowly!
nah we used to stopped for some reason.
Guys Ive read the whitelist info and everything. What would you say is the best way to get whitelisted? Is it literally just being genuine and interacting with everyone in the community then hoping to get picked?
man i think i wasted about a good 2 hours in jam on a working day
wow you have so much privelage i guess
Brother you should also visit Sydney
Think so. U can always try the giveaways and quizzes too
participate in all activities and try to stay active and make proper conversations and help newcomers!
Just be in chat and be nice and engage with everyone and you can stand a chance !!
It just stopped raining at my area but it will always rain during end of the year in MY
yes mate you have the most immunity other than asian countries
If you guys see someone suspicious  definitely a bot kindly report it at reportabot

Wah bro thats worse than me man where you work
are you excited to travel soon?

Whatttt bro you gotta get out of there!
Luckily Im still work from home no need to jam with others
Not much liking? My friend that moved to Aus always have her KFC craving fixed when she come back to MY. I guess thats the reason
Yes brother and Make sure you have a good breakfast at the breakfast club
wbandana To All New comers!!. Devs will NEVER DM you for anything! if you receive a DM claiming to be from Cosmic Wyverns it is a scam! please block and report STAY VIGILANT

Been around. Only continent I havent been to will be south America and Antarctica. Hahaha
welcome back man! hows your day
What Countries have you been in Europe
Thats right bro. Its a blessing when you dont even plan something or expect it and something just comes your way. Always always grateful
What do u recommended bro? I like KK one its jucier the one in Kuching are dryy af thats why i seldom have burger king here they ruined it 
Soy sauce chicken rice and vege as usual family dinner. how about u bro
yeah sometimes we need some good ol pan pizza! Yum
why are there cave 123? what it means?
my next stop on my bucket list i really want to go
different rooms for chatting bro
Just places where u can chat since theres cool down
Because one chat would be too much. It splits it up a bit
Guys I shared a meme at night with everyone!  httpsdiscord.comchannels902798623744618516902798624138862602903664330833264661
cave 2 have more the cool kids HAHA
I doesnt love fast food but sometiems you dont know wht to eat and fast food is the first one that comes to mind haha
Studied in Swiss. Worked in Swiss and London too. Visited Spain Italy Greece
make sure to report scam collections
Hey welcome back bro. Hows your day
i like to do for fast say rice and a stir fry takes 15 minutes
Yea covid his hospitality industry hard
They macam dont have breakfast on delivery menu leh
Have you ever watched a football soccer game
Got leh last time I ordered by using grab hehe
cave 2 unfortunately is the best room in this server to be at no disrecpect to the other channels JS
just joined and learning about whats this about
Yes. Watched a Chelsea match once when I was in London. U?
yeah same I am here to learn and have fun
Yesss their breakfast is like so yummy
can we rename this channel to cool kids?
I support Chelsea I went to there game once.
I see. I support man utd. Haha. But didnt get a chance to watch their match. Was a shame really. Should have made the effort to catch one when I was in UK
Yeah but the minimum requirement is you must have the leftover rice in the fridge haha
ayyyy man utd were kinda in the mud rn. ole OUT.
it was so good mate i have time to rest
if there is no grinding it takes away all the stupid discussions and people can focus on what they enjoy
i have high hopes for this project man
well i cheat so take me 30 minutes have to put fresh made rice into frig
I seriously never seen thhis before! Maybe im living in cave for too long XD i just check my grab there isnt such thing being offered lol
Yea man. Hes not coaching the team right. Whats the point of buying van de Beek and Sancho just to bench them? Makes no sense
and this one knows how to make real stir fry 
Thats the benefit living in KL you guys have the best offer as always haha
fax. donny and sancho has so much potential. just a graveyard of talent i guess.
Yea. He dont have a big enough charisma to manage the big names. Mcfred partnership not working at all. No tactical identity atm
having fried rice as my dinner man
HAHAHA should always prepare leftover rice and stored it in fridge in that case
Hopefully ole gets sacked tonight
Did u ever try Rice  Egg  Lunchmeat and soy sauce before?
Haha. Hoping they win tonight. But at the same time hoping they lose so Ole can get sacked. Conflicted right now. cracucumber31 Fred shouldnt be anywhere near the 1st team...
Hope so man. Especially with pogba out.
Tottenham might win pogba aint playing. dont know how long it will take for ole to go.
Back from dinner. Back to quality helpful comments
delicious i am craving for samgyupsal now. do you know that?
Whats your score prediction for tonights game
Yea. If we lose to Tottenham its gg man can say goodbye to top 4 even. Last week was such a pain to watch.
salad is just too good atm. couldnt stop liverpool theyre on form as well.
Asia is amazing I hope to visit soon
Surely ronaldo will turn up and score a hattrick
hahhaa oh i thought you are european. what country are you from?
do check out announcements  for more guys
Which part of Asia u like to visit bro
Yea. True that. But didnt expect to get our ass kicked so hard. If we lost 1 or 20 and gave them a fight then itll be alright. Just the way we lost is such a disgrace
Do you guys have a favourite fruit
Everyone remember to breath relax and not to take this to seriously  if its meant to be it will be.....so baby just let it be....
Haha. Lets hope so! Favorite fruit durian all the way man! Hahaha
no iver tried every meat leftover anything but NEVER tried lunch meat

So close yet so far away  for me 
Like I couldnt even believe I would make top 10 i am speechless rn 
Man I keep watching movies and missing on these trivia quizs hahah
no time to die friend keep up the hopes
Yes there are many ways guys !! Dont be disheartened
the feeling of sorrow and pain i wouldve been happy getting only that question right.
U joined on the 27th but start speaking literally after u win quiz  hmmmmm
Yeah haha but its alright keep going man
My guy you already wl lol give ppl a chance hahaha

True man! Lets keep it pushing here 
Is it bad to listen to the weeknd during weekday
and what? I was checkin all the announcementsetc... I gave up in advance that it would be hard to receive a WL here
Hey JuwulKruztul I just had a look through and they have taken it down. So I think it is resolved. They made a gif. Thanks for looking into it
Any good ideas for the weekend guys and girls ?
Its good to listen to the weekend and eat durian
The irony is strong on that one. I think thats why they made it lolol
sorry to keep asking but have you checked it?  
anyone know how often trivia is played?
Lmao just saying bro mods said u gotta be active and ur active after a dub bro sus
I gag whenever I smell durian. My mom is fine with it though
I will try to be more active since today hope that will work
They took my first entry  the cgi version of the Twitter pfp
Bro youll get use to it most of the chat was talking about durian
Wtf?! Congratz man lmao!!!!!!! A pleasant surprise
Yeah all good this end thanks!! Just been invited here and its Awsome! Are all the trivia times random ?
Shufflyk told ya homie you didnt believe me huh
lazy dao its ok I listen to it all the time
Gm dang even with slow mode on the chat is rolling
Thats what I like to hear bro !! Just been invited here looks Awsome! I think its going to be super hard to get one though 
Saw the message was highlighted and thought they tagged me instead it was  everyone lol
Big Asian community I suppose? I tried durian desert before. First time I nv finish a desert...
Bro I love how weve talked about durian for hours now 
Congrats to the trivia winners! I hope you enjoyed the quiz I made for you guys

Yeahhh good for you mate! Hope you having fun hereyay
Time to raveee guys I made the wl 
Ohh welcome to this hype community! Hope you enjoying
Ay!!!! Im one of the Green now!!!! Kishu dude. It was hard... had to guess on a bunch
Nah bro you coming in after the fact and tryna be active after the fact is unfair. We work our asses off in here for hours you said you simply gave up. And you think its fair? Bruh
Remember if you won the raffle or quiz but you havent met the requirements of more engagement to the community you will be excluded from winning
Thank u mods for making it fair and still making sure its active members winning
I love the smell but I dont like the taste hahaha
great added security feature for bots imo
Congrats to all our green homies tho!
Look at this we have a durian community as well
i got kicked already xd. thanks anyway
Hey if exp is locked today doesnt mean that ppl joined today cant win any WL spots? Even if they are active today?
This is the first time iv heard anyone liking the smell but not the taste its usually the opposite haha
Yeah I was reviewing ur history when i see ur complain. I was examining if ur deserving to be wl and I make ur dream come true
Really ?? Thats the first time I heard that
No mods are always watching! Dont need the xp for it
Hahhahaha but some durian dessert is acceptable
Hi again Kishu !! can you please check my dm  i sent u a screenshot
Dammm sorry bro  just engage and wait for next one
It honestly is who doesnt love it
Ow ok because i tries some times to get WL but i just joined today. I am a bit active tho! 
Ouch man  its alright keep it trying

We need to be fair to those who spend their time engaging to the community hope you understand thank you

I was going to go out for halloween but NFTs took over
yep its been crazy. ive been here since abour 20003000 members and its wicked to see the community growth. its all organic as well with no invite competitions
Quality community generates quality members!
Be positive and help out. You never know 
hahaha yeah not when i have a goal
Fun bro. Its question and answer of ABCD
Whats the hype about? Sorry I didnt get a chance to read roadmap yet
Yeah man we know what the aim is 
ya man supposed to be made for the tiger king 2 coming out on netflix in a couple of months
damn always missed the giveaway
Got my first 3d printer set up this AM 
Oh im positive but when is not up to you to get a chance is harder because they would just select ppl that they dont get to be as much active for random i have seen it on other projects where they never there and they do something and they would be like you get a spot
L this time but dont loose hope
Damn better luck next time congratulations to the winners
just curious would there be a public sale?
I agree but you cant win everything. Just keep going and have a great attitude 
congrats on the giveaway winners
Hey everyone how we doing today?

Yea I could as well stop entering those giveaway ahahah I got the worst luck out
Doing well man how are you? Chatting at work haha no choice
Congrats to the winners! You guys deserve it!
haha thats cooked ill still invest tho lol
lol. Ive done that before. but no XP today anyway right?
See you tomorrow at 9am aus time gn
Dont give up buddy! As long as we participate we stand a chance!
I know that but you have more control on leveling up then them pickIng you even when you here 247 they dont notice that on my opinion
what kind of work do you do its Saturday
Damn howd you get your whitelist
Correct. Not doing it for the x2 doing it for the community!!! We are purely organic
its okay leb! having the right attitude and mentality goes a long way! you will get noticed by the admins soon i believe
Damn a whole day for real not cool
I assist mentally handicapped adults with day to day activities. Like taking their meds making food for them doing laundry etc. my client is napping right now haha
Hahah thanks man Im trying you keep up the good work bro Im not to stressed about the giveaway I rather earn it anyways
Cool. Prob gonna be a busy day for me anyway. Halloween coming!
why not the mods care about our health they want to give us some rest so that we dont get FOMO and stay up all night
yeah man 100 always feels great to earn something instead of spoon fed
Yeah it suck plus if you level up is not by spamming you still engaging with ppl which is good
Continue to interact with people and have fun!
I got it by interacting and staying engaged in the community! When I first joined we had around 4K members and we are already pass 10k now all in just 2 days! Amazing growth but dont give up man! As long as you stay engaged and helpful the mods and team will see!
Thats crazy 2 days ago was at 4K thats nuts
Happy Halloween man!! Easily one of my favorite holidays 
Hi fam Im back from dinner! Hows every today?
How long did it take for you to reach WL?
Floppindix69 i dont but when you see u dont have the luck your like i wont be a lucky winner the luck is not on my side
dang we are at 10k already so fast
Thats awesome to hear. Im really having I have a chance on this one. TBH I like the way it looks better than a couple other similar proj I wont mention 
and all organic which is insane
Huge growth so far in such a short time
Just follow this persons example just keep being active and helpful and your efforts will pay off !! Congrats on the well deserved WL 
icescrollright Next collection is up on fanart  please support my work with a like! ogscrollright
For sure! And even in NFTland. There are lots of Holloween events.
It was 8k when i got in few hours ago lol
yessir we are going to the moon !!
I understand on there side but is really up to us to stay up or have some rest
So is the whole supply for whitelist
yeah many projects are doing halloween events
nice to see that you help elder people we need more people like you
organic growth is the best growth no cap wpirate
Plus they still get to check you history if you didnt spam
good morning fam! how is it over there?
I appreciate the kind words man
Getting in to the top 200 isnt the only way to get whitelisted there are many other ways to do so  and besides if you are still active in the community you will certainly get noticed by the mods
yeah i know but some of us are to scared that they dont make it and then they get almost no sleep which is bad four our health
So glad for that. I really really really really hate invitebased projects 
How did u guys get a green name
Great bro any plan for weekend?
Keep on chatting and stay active
yeah mate so awkward also due to the fact that I have no one to invite LOL
Love this did you make it yourself ? It looks very clean and professional
keep on pushing man! you got this
Now this is nice!! Tintin can we get this pinned?
Just hanging with the community might go for some mexican actually! what about you? any plans?
DNGYN Its cold. Its like 60 degree fahrenheit
I think i will win the next giveaway just screenshot this
Yeah I feel you man  but dont give up!!
I know right!? Even when I try my hardest I can only get like 5 invites max.
Im in school as well. What are you studying?
Yeah i know is many ways broh but i dont have enough luck to be pick and i have bad experience when it comes on them to select you so i rather level up and make sure i work for that and be a lucky winner with my luck
Be friendly and continue to interact and youll get your name in green as well 
damnn texas be cold as over in Australia its hot as right now
Super young plenty ahead. What you study?
Nice bro. Nothing much might bring my dogs to grooming tomorrow. You have any pets?
Mexican sounds great bro have you ever tried indian cuisine?
dont get disheartened. its a lesson about building the right community a successful project is built from its foundations so theres a method theyre implementing by hand picking the right people so that the project will be a success. If people contribute they will get selected as ultimately a collaborative group will be more successful
DNGYN So you understand. We dont like anything below 70
Tyro economics and business economics
yessir lets just vibe together and well get this WL through our support 
Yeah I hope I can make it. How long have u been on the server bro?
this such a good vibe in here and love chatting

Yeah i feel you but watch i would be here and not get lucky i know my luck so i rather get some levls up when i can i work so the time im not at work i try to invest on the community
thanks man i just wake up 30 min ago and prepare to breakfast 
The vibe is real. Where are you from bro
I have spent hours in this community but I would say quality  quantity! We really have a very engaged and diversified group of members in this chat which makes it easy to have meaningful conversation and interaction. I would say generally stay engaged have meaningful conversation and be helpful to others. The team and mods are always around and they will reward people who add value to the community!  We are building something great here and it is worth being part of this project! 
Been on since last night and now this morning doing my best here but its also fun!
weeeyyyyy bear gang assemble! more and more deluxe hands appearing! love to see our furry friends popping up
Aight im gona stay here i think i try my like in giveawaya
Im regret not to stay focus on Bio class in my school day. Bio is fun!
hahah you are early friend! keep the energy going!
alexeynag It isnt. I grew up in New York and have gotten used to no  snow.
fax this community is one of the greatest that ive seen!
best of luck to you as well pal
there is also trivias u can participate there
Whats up fellow Wyvern !! How have you been doing today ?
you still have enough time tomorrow you can grind but people also need some rest and the mods see that so have respect for the mods because i dont see other projects do this
Coach GregHey Coach Greg. Are you a real coach?
This makes me really excited  thank you my friend
I just havent got good experience when is a select and pick is a matter of luck not really that you contribute to community thats why i rather level up when i can
no sorry greg is a fitness youtuber
Dont be disheartened  about not being chosen for the white list remember that there are still spots available ! Keep grinding and try giveaways and quizzes !!
So youre a dog person? I got a poodle poodle mix and a doberman!
Coach Greg That counts. I teach PE
Yeah. You will never get bored chatting with people all around the world with diff culture. You learn something from every convo
heheh i ll be more nice with my omelette d
Good work man ! Keep doing this we need to avoid the scammers at all cost
Nothing much but all is good hoping for the whitelist
Thats fair point  but hard to level up sometimes  so I just try to help community
most of those level up projects fail not long after launch as the people who end up in the projects are typically flippers or arent in the project for the right reasons so the longevity suffers. but i understand your point nonethless
Doing great mate!! How about you?
I bet you do. Its hard to continue something that youre interested in
dog person for sure! i do not like cats at all even tho there is some stray cats around my neighbourhood.  hows the pet life? how long have you had them for?
Quite a fulfilling breakfast ready to grind all morning hahaha
I dont grind broh i just engage and level up the grindes are those who just send some ramdom msg i stay helping i just know my luck wont get pick so thats why i rather be leveling up by stay in convos with the wyverns
im sure the wyverns will need some honey lovers too! bringing the hives of bees will be too tempting haha
Hey nice to meet u bro. Where are u from bro?
just treat the raffles as a bonus and youll be alright my friend
CS is counter strike my friend it is a game. Do you play it?
LOL need some wvyern to get some of that honey
i see that as grinding you can grind by spamming but also by just talking with the people here
Im kot disheartening i know is alot of time but i dont trust my luck so thats why i rather go up and security a spot then taking chances
honey makes the world go round not long now! got my bear at the ready
My friend is playing it hahahah
Well if you put like you trying it would be hard but if you just enjoy the time you wont notice and you would get up there person experience
Feels good to be back from a nice shower
this. facts. love this vibe in here
i made my way into cave 2. PLEASE dont tell cave 3 yall!
Yes I do enjoy my time in chat tho !
DK for me haha Showmaker is new blood gimme that
Anyone got any cuisine suggestions to try ? 
you are not ready for Cave 4 yet 
Yeah i get you im not in the type i just rather security a spot then be a lucky shoot
Cave 1 was moving to fast for me O
I got my poodles since 2013 and doberman since 2016. They are pretty old actually. Old man in human age. haha are u consider getting your own dog?
they already won last year and im for the underdog
I love Chinese and Italian. So good
How long until u get to graduate bro?
Italian gets old for me. Its all just pasta lol
T1 already won 3 times just stop already lol
Oh yeah dont get me wrong im in to all that but i rather security a spot you get me
Yo bro you still here! Hows dinner going?
So..... im fairly new to discord how can i search to find all the posts tagging  everyone? on desktop
10 K organic growth now good job Wyverns!
i would love to! but unfortunately no ones at home to look after them since we all go to work 100 in thje future i would love to. any advice for handling them since you own 3 ?
I never get tired of pasta haha 
yeaa hang in there you got this!!
I am very very good sir  I see you everywhere tbh havent seen you in the Viking server tho
no way we just hit 10k wow thats crazy
Do the different caves have different meanings?
Thats not grinding due thats getting to know the community just like we doing so i guess you grindin right now i just like to meet new ppl
Canada is almost 11am right now?
we are now at organic 10k members congrats team
Yeah. Couldnt get bored with friendly people around!
definitely want to try italian you got any meal suggestions?
but its 5 years ago t1 havent been in worlds for 2 years
Exactly theres definitely a difference but I see what Coach Greg means. You might stray from convo and end up being a little spammy and Ungenuine
Hahaha yea its so good and so easy
Yeah thsts nuts. The amount of hype here is unreal.
Cave 2 is always here for u bro
Good day. What we up to today !
just grinding sir!   and i just have to pick and choose carefully which projects i get involved with running out of liquidity. 66
Four cheese stuffed shells sounds so good right now 
yep it crossed 10k mark without any shitty marketing
Just hunting for good projects while the market is bearish haha
I think there are bots here too. Ppl trying to win the gift and quizzes lolol. I think the admins are checking if people are legit 
yeah thats a good point lets hope we have a 5 game series
If you just have conversations with people for 5 hours how is that not grinding and only the real ones are here cuz there is no xp to be earned
Stop it ! I just had dinner hahah I SHOULDNT feel hungry again lol
qcapalot how you call spamming when you interacting with different ppl and get to know each other
Hey bro ! Hows it going my friend ! 
Who is been waiting for the Presale??
I just woke up so all this food talk has me feeling starved 
i am captain cave 2 welcome guysss
What other projects have you been involved with ?
thanks so much! definitely adding that to my list
Yo lets do our part to blow up their latest tweet yall get more eyes on this project organically!!! We attracting bluechip eyes
CosmicWyverns just posted a new Tweet check it out and follow us.
Discord already hit the 10k mark! No shilling and marketing involved. Pure organic stuff!
Im not saying what were doing is spamming Im saying if someone sits their for 45 hours and isnt interested with whats going on they might end up becoming fake and responding just for the WL type deal. Im cool with it man thats not me but for some people the shit definitely goes from chatting to posting gifs real quick lol
ill let you know when i try it soon!  thanks for the suggestion
Nothing much. Im in NFTs just 3 weeks yet. Ive been flipping solana projects but now solana projects are all bad. Not worth it
haha I told my bro to get a dog with his gf before getting married. So you know who will be doing the babys works. 
Anyway i think is important to have them potty train and teach them not to bite.
So i guess im not real because is no xp and im here and been here already 2 hrs engaging with ppl ? Kinda lost there
We determine the size of this project we the community!!
Good day bro but its raining season here at my area
we have such great mods! love how engaging and funny they are. really couldnt facilitate the community better
Hahaha trying to get you to have the most important meal of the day !
darthquinoa me too man  we miss you over there tho
Yeah me too.. Love the rain tho
Its breakfast time for me and you guys are making me hungrier lol
whats your fav sauce to go with it?
carbonara is delicious but so many carbs lol
yeah i remember when my missus first got her dog her dog would poop everywhere and get yelled at but now his such a good boy only goes to a fake grass patch they bought and poops there or pee there. definitely want to get  a dog soon maybe when i move out
I dont bc I gotta work in wet socks....
Ah i see well welcome to this community my guy. As you see it very lively
I need to get up and get on it then 
damn looks like the project is growing fast 3 general chats lol!
Well thats too bad bro  maybe wet socks gonna bring you to green... Who knows
I love a good creamy Cajun sauce or a homemade Alfredo
Yeah especially sleeping on a rainy night. Comfy af
I get your point i been here already 2 hrs and i dont call grind i just like talking to new ppl and i do this only when im not at work thats why i dont like it because during the time im at work im not active so my chances at less
I wish it was raining here its so hot
youre making me hungry right now hahaha

I feel for you ser but your hard work will pay off!

Yeah what i love the most about this community is that everyone is replying and communicating with each others instead of just typing a phrase to gain ranks
Yeah im in NY they have an event coming up on November 4th too apparently it involves an 80 FOOT Bouncy house. Not kidding lol
me2 what is your favorite team?
Ohh well that makes sense. Im in NY so its a little colder over here lol
ooh well grea tto see your name back on here  oh goodluck on your golf tournament! you got this! make sure you tell us how you do
I love basketball. Im a New York Knicks fan
Yeah I dont understand that I already reported one person as a bot because they just kept saying the same thing over and over again which is just weird to me...
my friend no swearing in this discord no mentioning of such names 
Yeah ikr and i love it so much hahaha. And have you went to ss15 bro?
I live in westchester but also live in NJ Fort lee
Criu thank you very much that really made my day BladeBK24 ty hope to see you on wl soon too qcapalot my other problem is that im no creative hahaha WLCC l Febe he will be next on wl and hope to see you there too  and sorry guys fornlate response was talking f1 in cave 3

Yeah been there once i think. KL was crowded with shopping malls. What so special about ss15 bro?
All good homie! Congrats on that WL tho 
Love it and this amazing community I call my family
Yeah they are definitely doing a good job cause theres no room for stuff like that here
Thats the way to go. Expect nothing and enjoy yourself
I agree even with the giveaways. They change if they got inactive account thats good
thats why you dont get to see those single repeated phrases hehe
Haha its ok bro. We chat again next time when youre in cave 2
FatMeow this community rocks man
Yeah I was seeing a bunch last night but thankfully none now
Yah!! Ill go again with my friends one day!!

thanks for always replying and giving me advice 
Verstappen is the best F1 Racer  then Lando
Yeap youre right they wanna make sure the WL are given to the one whos deserved
Yeap2 so its quite fair on the distribution
Another early adopter Who tipped you off homie 
Crazy that anyone was in here that early lol
WLCC l Febe Hahaha yees for sure Jen12 Sainz is the best driver taking away experience he just needs ferrari to get back on track. Also Lando y really good and future WC along Sainz and Leclerc
We are growing  very organic 10k already with no invite contest 
Thats the reason its more worth it to grind more
the hype is real my friend haha
Its crazy I joined earlier yesterday less than 7k. Fell asleep last night chatting here with 8k now its 10k...
nice what position do you like to play
Lets hope so the season would be nice to watch
Im convinced the first 500 are all people who heard from the original 100 type deal
Oh no. Have you been here all day? I saw you before I went to bed .... 9 hours ago!
I mean sheeet if I knew about it I definitely would have. An now look at the community! 11k and climbing. 15k by end of day!

We all do for sure. A lot of ppl are on autopilot. Theyre not present and they dont really know how to regulate their emotions or respond to things appropriately instead of just reacting to everything
Hahahaha yeah i am studying culinary art so its quite easy 
1000 messages is a lot lol... You definitely deserve a spot on the whitelist hopefully the mods are watching over you
Yup all organic growth with real people and real conversation going around here. Exciting stuff!

hey wondering why is there 3 caves ?
Congrats to winner dont put your head down those that didnt win more opprotunities will come bros
Big community needs more caves!
why is there so many cave chats
Because if there was only 1 chat would be unreadable
cause the community is just too big bro!

nice bro hows situation on there
Flem in here!!!! Kishu in here!!! its a PARTY
Enjoy yourself mate! Btw Cave 2 is the best!

to most of us that didnt win the giveaway keep out spirits up! im sure our contribution will pay off! just keep grinding guys we can do it!
to chat and enjoy bro stay where you want or leave in all the caves
it is we talk about durian all day 
The first yr sucked but we are starting to get somewhat back to normal here. Never going to be the same as before though I assume
there is to direct traffic so there wont be so many messages at the main cave else we wont be able to read anything
Dont lose your hope guys we all gonna make it trust me!
how do they decide if the reroll or not btw? activity?
Haha this is one of the reasons too
yep of course bro i lose a lot of near people to my in this pandemic
seems like many of those inactive ones got the luck of being picked haha
So many rerolls lmao its insane hope one of us cave 2 folks can win

Not exactly a level but you could get into the whitelist if you are the top 200 most active members check out whitelistinfo for more information on the ways you can get into WL. At the same time if you are active engage in real conversation and add value to the community the mods and team will see it and they will reward people accordingly!
There ya go! That will give you something to do!
i know i mean.. ITS GENIUS.. every project should do this!!!
see you tomorrow bro have a good one

I hope I put on notice been here since 500 members. Doing my best to help and spreado some positivity into the community
I have been living in the same area my whole life too and i am 35 lol... I need to go see some other countries before I am to old too enjoy it haha

Thats good man... I really hope you can make some big money in this field and get back on top of everything!!!
its getting cold out here omg lol

Facebook rebranding to meta has me so bullish on nfts thats insane to me that a hugeeee company like that would get so involved
Hello any admin or mods here. you can check my history when i entered this dc. im og here and idk why it left suddenly form this dc. thanks. hoping to get my role back.

CarlTheTurtle LLB blake thank you for the feedback
Hey whats up dude how you doing today?
they are really expensive right ?
Just here chilling while being at work
oh yea millions for the big ones lol

Can we get some more green names in the chat ? 
Working on the weekends sucks!! At least you can still get on here though haha
i have been seeing you a lot here nice darthquinoa do pop in sometime man we would love to have you back
what do you work as if you dont mind me asking
BoNFT I just thought of something rather funny
I have never been on one but maybe one day I will own one haha
Hard bro many ppl get green name and go rest 
I should! Have they added to the roadmap?
Oh thats good then.. Where are you from?
Yeah thats what I believe as well hehe  its well deserved 
CarlTheTurtle yes this is the way
just took a bath and came back refreshed!
yes sir do have a look !! minting is soon should be
Guden you adk any greens need any info
cant talk in chat 1 come to chat 2
i will be ok if my family its ok
is that the word on the streets? ima find out myself
i feel you man  but do come and say hi !!!
And this project looks too wild to pass up! I love the art here! Especially the blue eyes 
Keep up boys ! I really love the community
That sucks. I know the feels. Ive got enough to add one more. But thats it.
yes u are correct   this channel is cave 2
wats the difference between caves
Keep at it man your gonna get there. Crypto and NFTs can take us anywhere
yeah man too good an opportunity to pass up Bibleblack its the same just more places to chat !!!!
rofl someone from cave 3 also agreed rofllllll. ima stay here
Not really my last year of working
nothing really just differernt vibes in differnt caves
i love the vibe here  its the best out of 3 tbh
sure my man i need to change the life os my parents they give me so much
they are all the same bro there are just 3 of them since community is too big and 1 cave cant handle all of us
Congratiolations for the latest wl winners check giveaways
i mean if ur profile pic keep dancing for me like that. its hard for me to refuse
I said that I was done collecting for now since I really dont sell my nfts but this one speaks to me lol
Lmao   dun look at it 861687609490276382  join it
how many are WL allowed to mint?
yeah man i will always stay here
its the most active community in my opinion
Happy days for the new white listers we will get there
so is this project a kaiju king spin off?
No putting all my focus on crypto
I hope you get that wish man!! Just work really hard in this field and you never know where it may take you
its gonna be better than kaiju king 
they are omnipresent haha they are always watching like santa
i supposed is it 1 per WL given the limited supply of 3500
lets goooooo good to have you  i kinda am seeing a lot of familiar faces here !!!
Cincai  ARKIPEL  Legend look at my hips and be mesmerized 
Yea a bunch of people have been turning green today.. It is a good sign keeps us all going haha
Just chilling bro how about you
i think he is inspired from scratch. in the theme of wyverns
how so? im not familiar with this project wat makes it unique?
I think no difference its just so that there are not too many message on a channel so people can have genuine discussions
just look at the community growth 
Yeah i know what you do for a living
ahaha whats the difference between the caves? anything?
totally differente this is so much better and i like the art check some sneakpeek  bro
i wouldnt say which is good. both are good in their own ways. Wyverns seems like it is more towards gaming direction in its roadmap
i think its just to traffic messages make it flow smoother
I buy old houses and fix them up and resell you?
Cave 3 is where the cool wyverns are at is what I heard
Gotta pump those numbers up! Those are rookie numbers!
sounds good to me not a bad idea at all
Its been no time at all  just wait!
how about this ? Kishu Ryu Flem Mixks.eth Tintin
true the more you are active in each cave the more you are recognized so be sure to do that
I just noticed this server hit 10k crazyyy right
Exactly. That is what I call it but when i say that to some people they have no idea what i mean lol
Yooo thats so cool!!!!! PeepoClap
Yo whats up just came from cave 1
Did you just now make that phone case?
the vibe is as great as in cave 1 here bro 
Damn that good money i work in customer service
do you make good money doing that??
lol Im kidding 10k members may or may not be approaching the comfortable limit
cool wyverns are in all the caves bro we are a big family
at this rate the people are flowing in i might have to migrate to cave 3 soon
Hahaha I see yah take some rest mate!!
Big HGTV fan here. So I get exactly what you mean. Looks hard tho but I have no eye for design. What region you flip in?
just a hobby make some unofficial merch for a community
Yea it is not bad at all.. We have a 4 person crew and we just split everything 25
guys we have to be more carefull!!
 dont ever press any link from dm
 always see if the bot have check   in their profile to see if its a legit bot
 always use the official link FROM THE DISCORD CHANNEL
 buy a ledger or else you dont have to buy it but it is much safer if you have it
 some admin can be hacked too so always becarefull with some sus announcement
Temperature my wyvern brother! wthug
Yeah thats the main thing to do and thats where all start
i took a look of the roadmap the game they r making seems like a mmorpg type but that is very difficult to make could potentially take years to complete even for triple A gaming companies does the developer has any previous exp on game making?
only good vibes everywhere strong community here
I woke up at 4pm and now I cant sleep 6087sAdPePe
GM morning somkid how it is going?
Haha I love those shows too.. I live in USA  Pennsylvania you?
well said thats why we are here
I dont think youre understand wyvern fam but all is good 
Doing great mate!! Just chilling and chatting
haha is a real community will join here
yes i agree with you. one of them have prior experience on gaming development i think. I think potential collabs could expedite the whole process
I hope for the best for you man!
California. So we watch a ton of Flip Flop since its all around my area. Hope your flipping life is not as dramatic
Dipping my toes in the hot cave wingedwyvern
ofcourse i understand the feeling of being in one of the best communities
whahaha we good right here right  How u doing buddy
damn bro  what time do you go sleep usually
Byeeeee bring me some more charlie brown memes when you return
what the different between 3 cave ?
Haha good wyvern fam! How are you doing??
Lets go brother still got many slots left
guys i gonna take a rest see u guys tmr
Heck yea man!! It works out great usually. Some argument sometimes but not to bad hahaha
Idk maybe 7 in the morning PepeHands
gonna go to sleep now its almost 2 am here  good night my cave 2 peeps
yupe is always good to join early
Thank you i was tell my fam is about the wellness of the person with that and a dream everything could become possible
see you man the grind continues
Oh I will  just for you! Youre the only one that appreciates me! 
it is just to direct traffic so messages wont be spamming like mad in one channel
no difference just splits up a lot of the bulk of chatting
night night hope everyone doing great and healthy
Lmfao!! I have seen some things but no we are not as bad as on tv hahahaha.. I have bought old meth houses and seen some crazy shit lol
has anyone seen the gaming altcoins on coinmarketcap? all the gaming coins are going CRAZYYY thats actually wild
Goodnight turtle have a good sleep
goodnight people !!! i hope to see you all tomorrow homies
yeah i saw it did you get any exposure
Yeah i know but uf you a smart man you would save up and seperate from them soon is all better to be a full owner
Hmmm cave 3 has lower cooldown time
i have some ntvrk enj and vra but they havent gone too crazy. but decentraland is up 100 today and its the second biggest gaming altcoin thats INSANE
hahah any idea what cause the spike?
i just hope the dev can make realistic goals a mmorpg seems to be an over stretch a pixel based game is way easier to produce there is currently no real nft mmorpg on the market even for a company like illuvium with tons of experienced game developers  artists is still under development idk how a brand new nft can just make a game like that
Do they know you are into crypto?
bro you better get some sleep bro 
Alot of youtubers and people in the space in general have been saying a big gaming surge is coming because there hasnt really been one yet and the gaming industry is huge
really? cave 3 have lower cooldown time
Oh yeah i even try to tell them is now the time
Thats very disgusting. And its exactly why flippers are needed. Normies just want move in ready houses.
not sure bro go there and test hha
Well for now it wouldnt work out if i tried that because I cant afford to pay for everything or I would. I want to get enough money saved up to start flipping properties without houses or with houses that i dont need to work on and just sell for the land value but i got some saving to do first
Yeah i guess beacause less people are expected to be chatting in there haha
The MMO is a collab by the sounds of it!
just give us a couple days so the community will get bigger and we will need the forth cave 
Yeah its a collab we would gain additional items within the game because of the NFT
hmm yeah i agree with you and i feel you concerns are valid too. maybe you can offer some in the suggestion page. Maybe can we wait out for more info to actually understand what is going on. they might have something up their sleeves haha
I mean its about the same as here probably  
blake Hell yeah im just waiting for cave 4 at this point lol
Oh man it was so nasty!!!! We wore gasmask and plastic suits just to clean it out and then we tore it down to the bare frame and rebuilt it. It looked so nice when we got finished no one will ever even know what it used to be unless they seen it before
Well everything at its time no need to rush with Patience come s reward
its gonna be extremly difficult to collab a mmo my man game making doesnt work like that
unforunately we went into partical lockdown until december so we deft gna be living vicariously through everyones haloween costume posts haha
omg these gaming coin gains are buck WILD
thrruusst it all the way to the WL
cave 1 is so much faster then here its crazy
Illuvium has done the same thing with the cars! Its much easier to loan out some of the art for their wyverns than develop 100
Honestly i wouldnt be surprised if there is a cave 10 when this server explodes to near 100k memebers 
yea I can hardly read anything there lol
hahah but today out of so many days? there must a catalyst to cause it
exactly brother not sounds like a joke anymore D
naaiiss it sure does beats copy and pasting texts all the time. awesome efforst bro
i wish ive been to cancun before covid happened ive only seen it thru dvd parties lol
hahah i iwll not be surprised bro. it is actually better for communication but harder to manage for the team
hahahhah thats the reason we gonna stay active
Yeah i really am surprised how fast this server got to 10k.
So now i think anything is possible for this server!
thats right bro! everything is possible
a lot more calm here Holymoly  Legend its insanely fast especially without the exp incentive
Oh hell yeah more caves means you can actually have some civil conversations instead of one spam chat 
sure bro covid ruin many things an many plans and lives c
illuvium has 6b market cap my man i dont think we have much ETH to burn to make a mmo thats all im saying
ya I just go check only 15 sec is jg freak out there
Yeah its usually when someone asks a question they get the about 10 responses Not that thats a bad thing shows good community
yeah man! i can see people are starting to go out of control especially when there are  giveaways
Seriously impressive. Do buyers ever ask what happened to the old owners? And does your realtor just lie lie lie?
Johnny Quid  APE thank you much appreciated I just wanted something funny for adults  that must sound weird
Idk maybe because were getting closer to november or something? idk im hyper bullish for all of Q4
its ambitious but lots of project cant finish their roadmap a pixel based nft should just focus on pixel games imo
Oh yeah when theres a giveaway you know cave 1 is going to be poppin 
Wat I see is all spamming nonsense nonstop 
haha need to check out for the news soon. be sure to take profits along the way
huhuhuh i hope i will make itttt
Wonder what everyones eating today? 
Theres really plenty of time for everyone. We still so early 
Exp system is turned off for 24hrs lets just chill and wait for giveaways bro
i put 500 into 3 gaming coins last week once they double im gonna take out half theyre all getting kinda close already lmao
that pop real man hard even i can barely see my own messages
which coins are you in? im trying to learn more about gaming coins
i just read  has anyone win meme giveaway?
Cant go wrong with fried chicken  
LLB Thats a clasic meal I want some now!
Clovis Yeah i think we need a cave 4 asap because these chats are scrolling too fast!
nice! yeah it is always wise to protect your capital first. i wish you luck for the last 2 months in crypto
ntvrk enj and vra im probably gonna try to diversify a little more soon
Cosmic wyverns isnt the game company though its amethaverse
i want to build a gaming portfolio ive been putting it off for a while now. the FB rebrand news really kinda woke me up
hahah it is still quite manageable for now but im not sure after 12 hours later hahah
Thanks! Clover yea when i saw facebook rebrand i was actually shocked i never expected such a huge company to go so in on crypto let alone the metaverse easyscrubz
hahah i think they might take some time to transit.. time to relook into your port bro
thank bro  im going to check it
Well our realtor is one of our 4 person team so we pretty much leave it up to him to sell it lmfao!!! But normally no people dont really ask because they look like a brand new house when we get done
Oh yeah when the exp comes back online we gonna need that extra cave to save us 
not sure hah becoz dint see any from announcement
Zucks just trying to catch up to the winklevoss twins.
exactly so the dev has to pay amethaverse for the mmo and how much would that be? probably a lot ETH
hahah im gonna go watch and see
oh yeah! im really not looing for it to be back
i believe so by checking out your pfp 
for sure bro make some noise hahah
Brothers I hope you can check out my memes. I have low editing skills but did try my best lmao httpsdiscord.comchannels902798623744618516902798624138862602904062552097579090
no for now i think the closest you get should be mentalhealth or food hahha
BearX  Jack BearX  Jack will do my friend
Same I prefer some more civil chats but I gotta support the growth! I hope this server reaches 100k members some day!
But we will definitely need at least 10 caves 
Thats the way! Honestly just happy Im not looking to buy a house right now. Too crazy. So you must be doing well right now. 
hahah tell me which cave you going by then so i can meet you there
Thats good and im just chilln like a villn
im doing great ser how are you doing?
Oh for sure we gotta take shelter in that cave  
Hopefully we will both have our names in green by then too 
Pretty good now that Im off work! And u?
Amethaverse is creating an MMO cosmic wyverns is partnering to have things like the ability to bring your nft in theyre not paying them to create their own mmo haha. Have you looked at their site?
To be honest its kinda tough right now for us. We been in bid wars at every auction and they are going so high we dont have enough  to buy them. We are hoping it comes back down some soon but who knows if it will
Amazing sir every day is a beautiful day to be alive
that would be beautiful bro must easier to talk in the WL chat haha
We early to this nft space nothing more to be thankful for
Oh yeah if there is a white list chat then we could definitely have fun there 
It must be extra cozy in there 
yes sir you are right! many opportunities everyday when we are here in this space
if anything not being able to get wrecked in the gym is the most gutted of feels. what abt u bro where ur frm?
hahah yeah man! i really hope we both and make it there and have meaningful convo in building this community
amen man 1 year without banging weights sucked
I see dead people... HALLOWEEN is here tell me one spooky thing about this project typinghacker
its refreshing and not boring so it works!
Imagine I just got in 2 months ago if I got in 4 months ago cyberkongz bored apes cool cats would have been great entrys if thats 4 months ago some opportunities will pop up soon
i am from Russia not from States 
Oh yea I already know we will both make it!
As long as we have fun and keep doing what were doing now 
Johnny Quid  APE absolutely good point
whats good with cave 2! im about to watch the ufc main card whoops didnt mean to reply
Cincai  ARKIPEL  Legend you have to tell me 
yeah learnt from the missed opportunities and look forward. always stay vigilant hahah
haha no problem enjoy the fight
thanks for the confidence sir. i believe you will get there soon.. i wanna see you in green. but lets stay focus on the real convos for now hahah
Like crypto just DCA into what you believe in and can afford to
Nothing wrong with having a little hope and motivation though 
yeah! in a volatile space like this. DCA is definitely an important skill as part of risk management
thats a great way to look at things just about finding the right projects in such a growing market.
omg im WL didnt even realise HOLY
Oh shit. Thats really sucky. I guess theres a lot of competition to flip rn. 
haha yeah! having that small little chat got me dreaming about it and all hyped up
I would be back wyverns have a bless day
New to the server. Happy to be around
Thats the kind of energy we need!
I love having nice chats like these!!!
congratulations with your wl m8!!! lets go!
sorry guys i have been in and out doing stuff
Thats an awesome surprise. Congratulations 
thats okey u dont have to sorry for that!
Let me see if Ill get some love here. Main cave people dont love me

Jared4 defo I can see a lot of options for everyone joining to help them feel welcomed gut the project in itself rocks anyway
GM vee. Very bearX pfp. Is the project out yet ?
congrats! hope to join you soon
doing great broddy and what about u?
Nope not yet.. the havent announced a date yet..but I think soon 
after discord and twitter hack they still up impressive
Fine thx  just chilling and eating some pizza
i didnt get on bear x wl so no bears for me
Anyone please give me opinion? WWhat if we move to project to IMX as launch pad?
Ok awesome when it is minting ?
So many bearx gang in these caves so dope to see!
You wouldnt try sweeping the floor or that gonna cost to much you think?
no worry is time to get a Wyvern !!
guess i gonna have to eat smth 
TBA sir you can check in faqs  its Nov though
There isnt an official mint date yet. All we know for now is that its gonna be a whitelist only mint the discord was only made like 4 days ago so theres still some time until the official mint im sure.
ppl are gonna post there bears for alot
how we feeling today? where are yall come from?
feeling good about to hit the gym p from east coast U.S. you?
Keep calm guys and carry on typing responsibly   
It would be around secone or third week of Nov
Yeah but they handelt it pretty awesome 
deff eat up brother! and enjoy it
Ow ok awesome I will check that GL
lets say u guys get the wl and mint one wyverns after that someone offered you 3 eth what would you do?
half across the world im from indonesia. nice to emeet you fam
hell yeah didnt win any giveaway in bearx maybe this project is my chance to get wl
no worry u got the chance ! belive it !
True. I missed the kaijukingz WL. But after mint you couldve snagged the floor at .1 ETH. Considering where that projects gone if you have the liquidity it could still be a possibility.
Nope I tried so hard bro iam a bit frustrated though 
nice to meet you fam glad to see the diversity in here!
what is the price now? is it high?
HODL like my life depends on it
dont put your head down bro many projects coming
For sure always gotta be positive with all investments
hopefully we get on wyvern list who needs bearx
Yeah think I really like this one here hope this time its working out better for me wbu whats ur favorite project atm
Pennsylvania its a pretty lowkey state on the east coast
sure you will do it many spots on wl just keep active and engaging
For what I read almost al people is from America JJj. Rise Money ma Boys .
Nope buddy there are not out yet... hope u can get one than
Ah I heard of that. I have been to US as exchange student there. Its Oregon.
damn the green color looks nice
After they got hacked im not that intrested anymore 
you will make it to bro just keep helpful
Yes true..I will try my best  thank you for ur support bro
Be active and aware of giveaways so you can get one too 
they recover very good and i think the project have potential
That hack was ridiculous. Crazy to think how much money people lost.
Well u understand but that actually happens a lot. And everything is back right on track..so I dont think it matters
Yea it was really bad but they raised the mint price to .05 to repay those who got scammed so
no problem bro im here to help if you need something just tell me
Yeah that was nice to see. Its nice to see when a dev team cares about the community. And isnt focused purely on their payday.
Yep is true tho but I dont want to risk it that much anymore jsteuner yeees alot of money I would like to have  vee BearX well is also true but im a bit afraid of hackers 
True but also was a obviously scam. When ppl just buy without any idea about the project its not good
Man the hacker spammed the hell out of those announcements 
Yea for sure still think the hack messed up the stigma of the project for alot of people but the admins clearly didnt have bad intentions so im still rocking with them
Alright. Got some stuff done around the house now I got some time to check out NFT land.
I agree. Its always interesting to see how communities respond to set backs and stuff. Ive had a couple projects that had rocky starts and one pulled through while the other is still picking up the pieces.
I hope I can get a giveaway is that only way left for WL
Im still pretty new to this space so that was my first experience with something like that but the nothing about the project changed just a discord exploit and bad security by them. I still have high hopes for them
Yes. Rocky start doesnt mean a project is dead
Jacoos bear x did not me TheRealTomNook make sure to be active too cuz if you win and you are not they will reroll
ArmandoB damn bro your the only one whos active since got wl true wyverns

Me too. Im playing the early floor game on that one and hoping to snag a deal or 2. But well see. The initial price discovery for projects can be very intimidating. And hopefully I can snag a WL spot here.
there were closed for a while but they only opened up a few months ago thank god
I got whitelist over there thankfully. Was so happy thats the first big project i got whitelisted for
I DONT NEED XP I NEED my wyvern

lfg go bro i will invite my friends

Has Facebook already released if NFTs will be used with Meta?
ive decided to chill in cave 2 and occasionally go back to cave 1
its da kidd  wyvern thank you ma man!!! do you have one boonji? you should go get it its pretty cheap on OS rn
NFTQueen definitely   haha yeah i saw something like today is rest day or sth for the community
blake yup definitely gotta let the blood flow yknow otherwise its so unhealthy for the body
Yeahhhh boy thats the way to do it cave 1 is too fast to try and be in all the time
exactly plus i am trying to go for a walk in the evening
das right 4 years ago weve always lived by the quote the harder you work the luckier you get ye? pto
this cave is now quieter then cave 3 
So many people like to chill so they all are there D
Nahh bro idont ilike the concept tho and really ihavent checked whats floor rn?
Facebook Changes Company Name to Meta Plans NFT Support
Mark Zuckerberg has announced that Facebook will change its company name to Meta while retaining the old name for its social media platform.
With phone in hand chatting in discord 
PlayStation home was the original metaverse
blake hopes all fine w your legs take care!  hope you get da green light soon 
chasen8 haha its a fact w whatever youre doing in life
qcapalot need to grow more pairs of eyes to be in cave 1  
Chrisb960 the XP will be the same regardless of which cave we are in right? Mods be lurking around each caves?
zackemc if you believe you can achieve PTO 
its da kidd  wyvern floor pretty low think it is 0.38 now haha
ye brother good luck to u too! WAGMI!
Ahhaha oh yeahh thats not bad at all think ima go scope them out again thnks for the info 
Yup Ive seen admins and mods in all 3 caves just keep doing your thing and help whoever you see needs it D
The addiction is real lol. Since I got into nfts my sleep schedule has taken a hit but hey Im young lol. This is when Im supposed to do this stuff 
but didnt detect my rank sooooo sad
ahaha the same happened to me  literally have no sleep schedule at all rn 
Yeah so all we should do is to chill today. Tomorrow will be another hard grinding day haha
Yea were gonna just have to be ready for that counter to go off 
Are gas feed just based on their ETH traffic at that time or is there more to it? Nft addiction sounds more profitable than drug addiction
congrats to everyone family we just hit 11k wpumpkin 
its da kidd  wyvern yeah you actually should!! 
Chrisb960 absolutely!! been here for days and have been vibin and contributing as much as i can. made a few friends too lovin this community
I just dont sleep  or I sleep a lot to catch up. Not good at all 
Hahaha. TBD if less healthy or not.
crazycryptocake i have a dream when i wake up in the morning i want all of you to be richer and happier! 
blake hopefully ill see ya on the other side soon!!  
NFTQueen right. time to get ample rest to prepare for a long day of grinding tmr 
Where do you see this project in the future brother??
well ye  not that good for our health tbh
the way the project is growing and the art and the strong community do we need more ?
I think just traffic on the ethereum chain and then miner fees of course
we gonna meet again over there together!
Nope we honestly need to close the discord for now lol get some exclusivity going
Definitely is. Facebook trying to lead the charge by changing name to Meta lol
Nfts seem like an way to be a stay at home parent what are miner fees?
Zero. Hence we all here hanging out!
yeah right we need to recharge our bodies and mind very well
Yeah I dont want them to have that much power hopefully someone else can outpace them
Gross. I think for Facebook its too late for them. they need more than just a name change
That wont happen their gonna keep this open fs.
its da kidd  wyvern are you talking about Wyverns or Boonji brotha?
Owning Insta probably lets them reach a huge audience
Yeah I know definitely wont close
Good point I forget they have IG. Definitely more users there and younger audience.
yeah fo sure. its physically and mentally draining tbh! could take a toll on our health
If they could get to tik Tok the world would end
True I want someone else to get some money 
Yeah mark would do some bad things with that much power I feel like
Yeah so what are your plans this weekend
Finally this cave is slowing down
Please dont let them do that. As if theres not enough stupidity in TikTok already. Throw in the Facebook users.
Definitely not how you doing brotha
doing great so far and how are u doing today bro?
If theyre able to manipulate people that easily with Facebook I bet meta would be unimaginable
probably just gna stay in my mancave rest and chill out. hbu? any halloween celebrations?
Super excited for this project no cap
Yeah its just not gonna be a good look. Meta verse is the future but I dont want Facebook having control lol
Trying to stay here for few more hours and have some rest. Then maybe have some movie marathon with the family
For sure how long have you been chatting?
If theyre trying to brainwash stupid people are their target audience
We all are. Team organized community hyped and nice roadmap so far.
I am sensing this community will grow to 20k in just under 3 days
Yeah Ive been here since yesterday we doubled in members since then.
Guys Im so excited about this project i tried to make a hand drawn fanart  check it out and leave a reaction 
ye bro  thats gonna happen almost everyday i suppose the natural growth as it is!
Organic growth is the best growth
glad to be here just joined  loving the vibes
I just realized we officially hit 11k. 
Welcome creature just changed my pfp from my creature to this lol how are you doing brotha
mannn you need to pay more attention 
hopefully you get that wyvern looks bomb af!
Have you seen sneakpeek  yet? It looks insane
Yes bro but really love the arts!

Cave 2 is the move for sure Ill be back tomorrow
Thank you bro !! What tine is there ?
Lets make this community more alive everyone!!
The pixels seem to be the IT thing. so I guess I better jump on the bandwagon and add some to my collection! You got any pixels?
abcvisuals EVOLVING I Wyverns I appreciate your blessing buddy! Shall do better in the future
i just like pixelated art in general i bought a bunch of medieval pixel nfts but sadly they rugged me...but thats another story
maybe the next sneak peek i will put as my pfp
Thanks wagmi brotha just gotta stay active
yea its hard to find honest nft projects nowadays so stay safe and alert guys
Yeah I wanna be more original I see a bunch of people with mine but only way to do that is to actually mint one lol
Sucks. I feel like most of us been rugged at least once. Like a rite of passage in NFT land
its sad though...newbies dont want that first experience and it will drive them away
whats good cave 2 anyone watching this ufc card rn?
Yeah people who rug will def have some karma tho
Hows everyone weekend going soo far?
What are easy ways to tell if an NFT is an honest one or not?
it will come to them eventually
by the decisions that team make
Whats up brotha congrats on the whitelist not watching the ufc card actually spending some time with family
Doing good thanks how are you doing?
I hope this projects turns out to be the good one. Already like the direction the team is taking
yep thats why im waiting because many people have the same
It does suck. Rugs gas and hacksscams. Hopefully it improves quickly cuz were all here early and want the space to grow.
